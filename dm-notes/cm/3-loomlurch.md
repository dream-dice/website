- [ ] Letters


> Sister,
>
> I don’t have Elidon’s horn. If I did, I would use it to free Bloodybeak and send it after the jabberwock that lairs in the palace and hunts in your forest. No matter what Endelyn says, that burbling beast of a dragon is a threat to our coven and our three realms. How Zybilna managed to befriend it, I’ll never know! Maybe we should ask her—ha ha.
>
> Much love,
> Lorna



> Lovely Skab,
> 
> The last time I saw the unicorn horn, it was in your possession. Pity you lost it. But fret not! I have gazed into the Orrery of Tragedies, and it has revealed to me that Elidon’s horn will be found.
> 
> If worse comes to worst, recall that Elidon’s mate still dwells in your forest. You could kill Lamorna and take her horn—assuming, of course, you’re not too busy making toys.
> 
> Your darling sister,
> End


> Dear Sister,
> 
> There’s no use asking Endelyn if she has the horn. She doesn’t tell us anything! But if we don’t find it soon, I fear what the jabberwock will do after it gets tired of prowling the forest and turns its fiery gaze elsewhere. Gods’ bodkins, that thing gives me nightmares!
> 
> Must I remind you that we need a unicorn’s horn to free creatures from the cauldron’s time-freezing magic? It’s not enough to know their true names, you know. Of course, my greater concern is that someone else finds the horn and uses it for exactly that purpose. What do you think Zybilna will do to us, we treacherous three, if she’s no longer bound by her cauldron’s magic?
> 
> Your beloved sister,
> Lorna
