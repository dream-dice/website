# Scarlet Sash Manifesto

The members of the Scarlet Sash are dedicated to keeping the gates to Shadowfell safe. We were born from Shadowfell, known as Wereravens. We exist as a way to quell the horrors that lie within Shadowfell.

There are only a handful of gates to Shadowfell, and we hold the keys to all of them. We have tried destroying the gates in the past but only to see them reopen again.

For those who wish to join our group, you must obey the following rules

1. You will not harm or bring evil upon the innocent.
2. You will not abuse the knowledge of Shadowfell.
3. You will observe all that is true and just to the best of your ability.

You do not need to be a wereraven to join the Scarlet Sash. If the leader senses you are good and believes you will uphold the manifesto, they shall bestow the wereraven gifts.

If you wish to leave the Scarlet Sash at any point, you are free to do so.

If you are no longer a wereraven then you will not be permitted in the organization, though the doors of friendship will always be open to you.
