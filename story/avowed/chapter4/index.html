class="content mt-3"><h1>A Curious Raven</h1><p>The adventurers stepped through the door, and the site that beheld them was shocking. Matreous was on the floor. Blood pooled around his cold dead body. On closer inspection, a note was clutched in his hand.</p><blockquote><p>Freyot should no longer be trusted</p></blockquote><p>Pittacus and Jannusi entered the room. Immediately Jannusi accused them of murder, though they managed to convince her of the truth after explaining what they found in the mansion. While Jannusi handled the deceased, Pittacus took them on the rest of the tour that they had started that morning. He explained several key things of Candlekeep, such as the rules all the Avowed must follow</p><ol><li>No fighting</li><li>No stealing</li><li>No copying</li><li>No damaging, marking, or otherwise modifying the works</li></ol><p>Over the next few days, many people came back to Candlekeep to mourne Matreous. On the third day, at low tide, everyone made their way to the Candlekeep tombs to carry out Matreous's funeral. Most of the Avowed who showed up donated pieces of work in his honour, our group of heroes entered this poem</p><blockquote><p>man called matreous, you dun betray'd us, you is dead, book is bread</p></blockquote><p>By all accounts, Matreous was a well-loved individual, and no one had anything wrong to say about him. He has been responsible for expanding many rooms throughout Candlekeep with magical mansions and was researching ways to improve this when he became trapped inside Fistandia's mansion.</p><p>The group spoke to the Ogre, The Little One, in The Hearth to learn more about Freyot. He told them that the name had come up before, but he had never met anyone named Freyot, and there was no Avowed who used that name. Once before, someone named Lirial was exiled after it became apparent the Freyot told her that as long as you took less than half the book out of Candlekeep, the spell that triggered its theft would not be activated. Freyot told another individual named Francis that you could use the message spell to dictate the books to someone external to Candlekeep. After he did this enough, his voice was lost, and as penance, he has been working on maintaining Candlekeep. He is currently working on a broken elevator in The House of Rest. Between him and the group, the consensus was that Freyot must exist, and that they do not force anyone to do anything wrong but instead give them ideas that are in turn dangerous. Perhaps Freyot's recent necrotic activities reveal their real intentions. Freyot could be an alias for someone else who resides in Candlekeep. It would seem that Fistandia is still alive, given their homunculus. Corriander was still alive when they left the mansion, which may give other leads, though no one knows where they are.</p><p>Everyone in the group focused on finding out more about Matreous and whether he had any connections to Freyot, and when they sent letters to his friends and family, a raven flew through a window, dropping a battered book at their feet. The book was titled "Book of the Raven" but had no author. Before Florian could communicate with the raven, it flew away. P#erhaps they would cross paths again.</p><p>Together they studied the book. The Book of the Raven is the firsthand account (written in Common) of an anonymous author who, after falling off her horse and breaking her leg, was rescued and befriended by Vistani travellers who graciously nursed her back to health. The author and her horse travelled with the Vistani for three months, during which the author spent most of her time laid up in a Vistani covered wagon, where she took to writing this book to pass the time. Although a dozen Vistani is colorfully described in the tome, only two are mentioned by name: Drasha, a teenaged girl who applied bandages and poultices to the author's wounded leg, and Darzin, a one-armed boy with a terrible fear of wolves who sang beautiful songs to help the author take her mind off the pain.</p><p>The book provides a detailed account of the Vistani way of life, emphasising their food and music. Their overland journey is also discussed, albeit from the viewpoint of one who spent most of it inside a covered wagon. The author describes rough roads, days of travel through the impenetrable mist and thick forest, crackling fires on cold nights, wolves howling in the dead of night, and ravens pecking at the roof of the wagon in the wee hours of the morning.</p><p>Late in the book, the author writes of hobble about on crutches. She describes the cheery mood of her benefactors as the Vistani caravan travelled a winding mountain road to the gates of a tall, dark castle. The book ends with a description of the castle's dreadful countenance. The writing abruptly stops on the third-to-last page, suggesting that the author snatched the book in midsentence. The last two pages are blank.</p><p>The book also contained a copy of a map with the title "Evil Beware". The map included a root starting at Wytchway, leading to a place known as The Hand & Horn, passing Threetree Hill, going over Wood Bridge and just before getting to a castle, it stopped at a site labelled Scorch of the Red Wyrm. There was also an inscription on the map</p><blockquote><p>Follow the trail, To the Hand and Horn, Past Threetree Hill, Over a river worn, To the wyrm's mark, In the foggy moors, West of there, The treasure's yours.</p></blockquote><p>The mystery placed before them led them to talk to Khe'irl, the smithy who told them that he knew where Wytchway was, a ghost town and that he hadn't heard much of it in years. They bought two ponies and two mastiffs to make the journey faster. Timagast also bought a pet frog to keep him company along the way.</p><p>Before they left, they met Kazryn Nyantani, who shared a lot of information about the Vistani and other cultures similar to theirs.</p><ul><li>The Vistani are planar travellers often encountered in the Shadowfell, and they seem to be immune to the despair that besets all other visitors to that plane. They travel in horse-drawn, barrel-shaped wagons and have no permanent home.</li><li>The Vistani display their wealth openly as a sign of prosperity, sharing their good fortune with friends and strangers alike. Vistani resolve disagreements through contests that end with reconciliatory singing, dancing, and storytelling.</li><li>Vistani families can be big or small, but each family is a gerontocracy, with the oldest member ruling the roost. This elder is responsible for enforcing traditions, settling disputes, setting the course for the group's travels, and preserving the Vistani way of life.</li><li>The Vistani have the power—some say gift—to travel through the mists that lead to forlorn realms within the Shadowfell known as the Domains of Dread, where creatures born in darkness dwell. This "gift" was thrust upon them by mysterious entities called the Dark Powers as a boon for their kindness toward strangers.</li><li>The Vistani believe that ravens carry lost souls within them. Hence, killing a raven is considered bad luck in Vistani culture.</li></ul><p>When they got to Wytchway, they found very little there. Most shops and buildings were derelict and boarded up, with few inhabitants. They entered a saloon where a confused but surprised individual greeted them. He offered them some bread and mead for one silver piece each. The bread was as hard as a rock, and the mead had grown bacteria the size of raisins. They politely passed but asked about the place. The person behind the bar told them that Wytchway used to be relatively prosperous, but only five people live there now. When asked about locations on the map, they mentioned that the Hand and Horn used to be a place where the village would celebrate their annual fertility festival, and everyone would go there and drink and party the night away. That is until one year when seven ghosts, who resembled Timagast, showed up. After that, everyone started leaving as mysterious events happened. The bar staff did not believe that the village was cursed and stayed where they had grown up. They asked the group to go to the Hand and Horn to get rid of the ghosts there, though they could offer no reward as the town had nothing.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div><script>!function(l){function e(e){for(var r,t,n=e[0],o=e[1],u=e[2],f=0,i=[];f<n.length;f++)t=n[f],p[t]&&i.push(p[t][0]),p[t]=0;for(r in o)Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(o,r)&&(l[r]=o[r]);for(s&&s(e);i.length;)i.shift()();return c.push.apply(c,u||[]),a()}function a(){for(var e,r=0;r<c.length;r++){for(var t=c[r],n=!0,o=1;o<t.length;o++){var u=t[o];0!==p[u]&&(n=!1)}n&&(c.splice(r--,1),e=f(f.s=t[0]))}return e}var t={},p={1:0},c=[];function f(e){if(t[e])return t[e].exports;var r=t[e]={i:e,l:!1,exports:{}};return l[e].call(r.exports,r,r.exports,f),r.l=!0,r.exports}f.m=l,f.c=t,f.d=function(e,r,t){f.o(e,r)||Object.defineProperty(e,r,{enumerable:!0,get:t})},f.r=function(e){"undefined"!=typeof Symbol&&Symbol.toStringTag&&Object.defineProperty(e,Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"}),Object.defineProperty(e,"__esModule",{value:!0})},f.t=function(r,e){if(1&e&&(r=f(r)),8&e)return r;if(4&e&&"object"==typeof r&&r&&r.__esModule)return r;var t=Object.create(null);if(f.r(t),Object.defineProperty(t,"default",{enumerable:!0,value:r}),2&e&&"string"!=typeof r)for(var n in r)f.d(t,n,function(e){return r[e]}.bind(null,n));return t},f.n=function(e){var r=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e.default}:function(){return e};return f.d(r,"a",r),r},f.o=function(e,r){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,r)},f.p="/";var r=window.webpackJsonp=window.webpackJsonp||[],n=r.push.bind(r);r.push=e,r=r.slice();for(var o=0;o<r.length;o++)e(r[o]);var s=n;a()}([])</script><script src="/static/js/2.b2e87191.chunk.js"></script><script src="/static/js/main.a7b15408.chunk.js"></script></body></html>
