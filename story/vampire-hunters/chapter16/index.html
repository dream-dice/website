the Vengeful</h1><p>Whilst the interrogation started a curious event occurred. A powerful blast of energy exploded from the teleportation circle on the floor, and out sprang Godfrey, but not as anyone remembered him. He was accompanied by two of Strahd's zombies, the Butler and the Lady-in-waiting that they had been searching for. This blast was so powerful that several of the adventurers fell to the floor.</p><p>After the Zombies were taken care of the adventurers were unable to stop Victor from fleeing as he cast invisibility on himself. Izek took everyone downstairs and the Baron gave them their reward. Godfrey spoke to the Baroness and promised he would help out on the day of the festival with her charity for the <code>Needy Children of Vallaki Whose Parents Have Been Locked in the Sotckade</code>. Here Izek left the group and said he would stay to look after Ireena.</p><p>I was in the Blue Water Inn when the adventurers arrived, I was shocked and amazed that they were joined by a shrivelled and broken man. As he sat down to tell us his story I offered that we instead go into his memories and relive the events that lead Godfrey the Vengeful back to his friends. I have tried to write the encounter as though it was me being manipulated and toyed with by Strahd, though I will never be able to do justice to the horrific scene then fell before us all.</p><blockquote><p>Everything was a blur, Strahd had a hold over me and I was unable to control my body or my sense of self. I kept slipping in and out of consciousness, not knowing what was happening or how long I had been like this.</p><p>I awoke in the dining room, this time however the real Strahd was stood by the fireplace, not the illusion playing the organ. He asked me "I can tell that you are somehow connected to me and that you are descended from royalty. Tell me more about this.", I went on to tell him about my past and the plague on my land.</p><p>Strahd seem uninterested in my story, only to remark, "That plague is certainly related to Barovia. When I first erected this castle one of my first servants fled, and I assume that his disease has spread to your land." Strahd continued to tell me about his love for a woman named Tatyana, whose portrait was above the fireplace. I didn't notice the first time I was here but the image was certainly Ireena. He said how his brother, Sergei, was betrothed to her and he killed him and Tatyana had fled. He believes Ireena is the true reincarnation of Tatyana and will stop at nothing to have her as his bride.</p><p>"What are you feeling for Ireena, do you love her?", I was taken aback by this question, "I am sworn to protect her, I am a guardian. I have no feelings of love for Ireena."</p><p>Was Strahd relieved or was he more confused, I couldn't say for sure. It didn't matter, however, "Rahadin, take him away, he is not who I thought he was, the reincarnation of my brother. Give him to the doctor and let him play with this man, I am bored with him".</p><p>Rahadin dragged me with ease and took me down, down, down into the depths of the castle. I slipped in and out of consciousness again, unable to do anything. When I came to a man was stood above me as I was strapped to a table. The stench of uncleanliness filled my nostrils, leaving a horrible imprint on my brain. He took out a gnarled dagger "Last time I tried this it killed my subject, but I am sure I have it write this time." The doctor thrust the dagger into my chest and instantly my veins pulsated with searing black pain.</p><p>I came to and I felt at peace. There stood Helm, the light emanating from him filled me with joy. "Helm, please let me live, I swear I will take on Strahd and rid this land of him once and for all", he nodded at me and the light faded.</p><p>I came to, and my veins fought the black darkness and instead light burst forth from me. The doctor flew across the room and vapourised as he hit the wall on the other side. I could tell then that I was not myself, I was something else. I was Godfrey the Vengeful.</p><p>I had nothing except some loose clothes. I escaped, running through the castle in blind fear. I came across a room with a light circle in the middle. I dared not go towards it, and as I turned back two zombies pushed me into the circle. I found myself hurtling towards Xerus and knocking him prone in the process.</p></blockquote><p>After this everyone was stunned and did not speak of it again. I suggested they talk to Madam Eva who would help them defeat Strahd. They told me of their card reading and they decided that the marsh was their next destination.</p><p>The baron gave them an artefact which he was told would be of use to them. The scroll screeched when he took it out of the box. Only Zordar, who had learned Primordial, was able to understand it. It told him that it was a cypher scroll, created to lock and unlock the mines so the Strahd was unable to get in. If they could decipher the word on the box then he would lend Zordar his power of greater restoration once a day. Arty's brain quickly went to work and in no time the group had opened the box.</p><p>Once everyone went to bed for the night, Dwight snuck up to Urwin. He showed him the feather Mirapetor had given him. Urwin told Dwight about the Keepers of the Feather. A group of were ravens who were always out to protect people from good people from Strahd. "You got that from M didn't you?", he said to Dwight, and Dwight asked about the Oathkeeper, a weapon of immense power that Mirapetor had discovered was in Urwin'spossessionn. "You can have the bow, I ask that you do a job for me. My father owns and runs the Wizard of Wines. Whilst he is alive I get nothing, if you can kill him and make it look like an accident I will give you the bow." Dwight's greedy eyes grew wide and he agreed to take the job.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div><script>!function(e){function r(r){for(var n,i,l=r[0],a=r[1],f=r[2],p=0,s=[];p<l.length;p++)i=l[p],Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(o,i)&&o[i]&&s.push(o[i][0]),o[i]=0;for(n in a)Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(a,n)&&(e[n]=a[n]);for(c&&c(r);s.length;)s.shift()();return u.push.apply(u,f||[]),t()}function t(){for(var e,r=0;r<u.length;r++){for(var t=u[r],n=!0,l=1;l<t.length;l++){var a=t[l];0!==o[a]&&(n=!1)}n&&(u.splice(r--,1),e=i(i.s=t[0]))}return e}var n={},o={1:0},u=[];function i(r){if(n[r])return n[r].exports;var t=n[r]={i:r,l:!1,exports:{}};return e[r].call(t.exports,t,t.exports,i),t.l=!0,t.exports}i.m=e,i.c=n,i.d=function(e,r,t){i.o(e,r)||Object.defineProperty(e,r,{enumerable:!0,get:t})},i.r=function(e){"undefined"!=typeof Symbol&&Symbol.toStringTag&&Object.defineProperty(e,Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"}),Object.defineProperty(e,"__esModule",{value:!0})},i.t=function(e,r){if(1&r&&(e=i(e)),8&r)return e;if(4&r&&"object"==typeof e&&e&&e.__esModule)return e;var t=Object.create(null);if(i.r(t),Object.defineProperty(t,"default",{enumerable:!0,value:e}),2&r&&"string"!=typeof e)for(var n in e)i.d(t,n,function(r){return e[r]}.bind(null,n));return t},i.n=function(e){var r=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e.default}:function(){return e};return i.d(r,"a",r),r},i.o=function(e,r){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,r)},i.p="/";var l=this["webpackJsonpdream-dice"]=this["webpackJsonpdream-dice"]||[],a=l.push.bind(l);l.push=r,l=l.slice();for(var f=0;f<l.length;f++)r(l[f]);var c=a;t()}([])</script><script src="/static/js/2.a92de013.chunk.js"></script><script src="/static/js/main.372dad22.chunk.js"></script></body></html>
