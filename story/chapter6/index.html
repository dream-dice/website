Xerus had previously been in the village and knew of a tavern nearby that served wines and ales where they could rest, but so much time spent inside his ring had damaged his memories and he could not remember anything about its location.</p><p>As they made their way through the village the smell of death filled the air, and the cries of a woman in despair filled the cold night air. They had no trouble finding the tavern, Zordar desperate to quench his thirst for alcohol rushed the bar.</p><p>A man who was sat by himself saw the group and asked them to join him where he would pay for their food and drink if they would hear his story. Ismark, the son of the recently deceased burgomaster, told the group about his father and that no one in the village would help him and his sister take to bury the body at the church. In exchange for the drink, food and board the team agreed to help Ismark.</p><p>After drinking an alarming amount of expensive wine and ale they made their way to a rundown mansion. Inside they drank and ate some more and Ismark gave the group a map of Barovia. During this time Godfrey regaled everyone with his tragic tale;</p><blockquote><p>I am the bastard son of The Duchess of Danesti. Two brothers, Maximilian and Alexander, from the family of Cammerer-Durville, the monarchy of Osterreich travelled to the country of Walachia to visit the Danesti palace, for they were to be presented to the Danesti family as suitors for their daughter Gabriela. As the story goes, Gabriela fell instantly for Maximillian but was forced to marry Alexander as he was the eldest, and had more battle experience. The country was divided at the time and the Baron of Danesti feared an uprising. Wanting his daughter to be kept safe. They were betrothed and the dowry handed to Alexander. They had 3 children in total, but only 2 that Alexander knew of. Gabriela had me and my father is Maximilian. Upon discovery of this fact, I was banished from the country and sent to a monastery in Venta Belgarum (Winchester). Unbeknownst to the new Duke of Danesti, the monastery here was that of crusaders and paladins, who fought for justice and with divine sense. Fighting only for the good of the people. Years went by when eventually I returned to Danesti, to find the country in a state of ruin and Plague. I approached the castle and announced his name. I left the land on a mission to find the source of this plague and find anyone who can help me, no matter the cost.</p></blockquote><p>In the morning, the welcoming aroma of a cooked breakfast filled the house as Dwight created breakfast for everyone. Ireena, a beautiful woman with striking red hair, came down and it was revealed that Strahd had twice taken her to his castle, though she has no memory of these events. The adventurers agreed they would help take the body to the church with them. First, they attended some errands.</p><p>They made their way to Bildarth's mercantile. Bildarth is a rough individual whole that will sell many common items at ten times their price. He hardly ever haggles because he is the only merchant in town. Whilst the group were making purchases Gorek got into a dispute about the prices and Bildarth's son, Perimple stepped in giving a warning punch where Godfrey quickly stepped in and stopped the fight. It was here that Bildarth revealed two things of interest to the whole group. Firstly was that the woman crying, known as Mad Mary, lived not far from the shop and no one has approached her asking why she cries. Secondly was that the Vistini, a group of people who live in Barrovia, might know about a spellbook that Godfrey was carrying.</p><p>All but Xerus and Dwight left for the tavern, and Dwight asked about the windmill deed which was in his possession. Bildarth informed him that a hag roams the streets at midnight offering dream pastries and that she is the current occupant. He also revealed the location of the windmill on their map. The others met the Vistini at the tavern, who told Godfrey of a woman named Madam Eva who knows many things about magic. They instructed him to take his spellbook to her where she might be able to tell him about its contents as well as offer services such as future readings.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div><script>!function(e){function r(r){for(var n,i,l=r[0],a=r[1],f=r[2],p=0,s=[];p<l.length;p++)i=l[p],Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(o,i)&&o[i]&&s.push(o[i][0]),o[i]=0;for(n in a)Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(a,n)&&(e[n]=a[n]);for(c&&c(r);s.length;)s.shift()();return u.push.apply(u,f||[]),t()}function t(){for(var e,r=0;r<u.length;r++){for(var t=u[r],n=!0,l=1;l<t.length;l++){var a=t[l];0!==o[a]&&(n=!1)}n&&(u.splice(r--,1),e=i(i.s=t[0]))}return e}var n={},o={1:0},u=[];function i(r){if(n[r])return n[r].exports;var t=n[r]={i:r,l:!1,exports:{}};return e[r].call(t.exports,t,t.exports,i),t.l=!0,t.exports}i.m=e,i.c=n,i.d=function(e,r,t){i.o(e,r)||Object.defineProperty(e,r,{enumerable:!0,get:t})},i.r=function(e){"undefined"!=typeof Symbol&&Symbol.toStringTag&&Object.defineProperty(e,Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"}),Object.defineProperty(e,"__esModule",{value:!0})},i.t=function(e,r){if(1&r&&(e=i(e)),8&r)return e;if(4&r&&"object"==typeof e&&e&&e.__esModule)return e;var t=Object.create(null);if(i.r(t),Object.defineProperty(t,"default",{enumerable:!0,value:e}),2&r&&"string"!=typeof e)for(var n in e)i.d(t,n,function(r){return e[r]}.bind(null,n));return t},i.n=function(e){var r=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e.default}:function(){return e};return i.d(r,"a",r),r},i.o=function(e,r){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,r)},i.p="/";var l=this["webpackJsonpdream-dice"]=this["webpackJsonpdream-dice"]||[],a=l.push.bind(l);l.push=r,l=l.slice();for(var f=0;f<l.length;f++)r(l[f]);var c=a;t()}([])</script><script src="/static/js/2.9cb14b68.chunk.js"></script><script src="/static/js/main.c64f823f.chunk.js"></script></body></html>
