*Date:* 2022-01-10

Everyone manages to figure out how to open the door and leave the mansion, only to find Matreous dead.

* Everyone heads upstairs and into the Attic.
* Florian and Timagast fall through the floor, and a large bookshelf attacks them.
* Everyone manages to slip out of the room and proceed to attack the bookshelf from outside in safety.
* Cloud turns the bookshelf into a magical + 1 flail.
* Together they solve the mystery of the observatory, only to find it opens the door to the chained library they just destroyed.
* They find a book with the letter L on it.
* There is also a bedroom on the same floor, with a journal from Fistandia.
* The journal has the letter E on it.
* They go into another room with a fireplace and are attacked by flying swords.
* In here they find another journal by Fistandia, this time it mentions how Freyot convinced him to make a mansion to steal books.
* Since this is technically stealing, Freyot blackmailed him into letting them do necromantic research in the cellar.
* They found a book with the letter Y on it.
* Cloud works out that the letters spell the word LIBERTY, and the door opens up.
* When they leave, they find Matreous, dead on the floor.
* In his hand is a letter which says &quot;Fistandia can no longer be trusted&quot;.
* Junassi, the Master of Candlekeep, showed up to find out what happened to the missing Matreous and then the missing new Seekers.
* She accuses them of his death but quickly dismisses that idea.
* The group finishes their tour with the rules of Candlekeep.
* Little One tells them that he has heard the name Freyot, but there is no record of them ever existing.
* Freyot seems to bring people into trouble by showing them workarounds the rules.
* Together Firewatch and Little One conclude that Freyot is testing out their theories on innocent Avowed.
* One person <name> lost their voice when using the message spell to dictate books to someone on the outside. He is currently working on the elevator.
* Another person was exiled after learning you can steal part of a book, but then was caught after it was discovered that stealing more than half the book would return the book catching the culprit.
* Afterwards, they went to find out more about Matreous and understand why he would cross paths with Freyot. He seemed much loved by everyone.
* They sent letters out in the Rookery, and whilst they were doing this, a raven dropped off a book.
* They named it the &quot;Book of The Raven&quot;, it told of a girl who broke her leg, and Vistani took her with them. Suddenly the book cuts off, and pages were torn out.
* There was a mysterious map, with a path starting at Wytchway and ending at a castle.
* They bought some steeds and went to Wytchway to solve the mystery of the book." data-rh="true"><meta property="og:title" content="Session 3" data-rh="true"><meta property="og:description" content="# Leaving the Mansion
