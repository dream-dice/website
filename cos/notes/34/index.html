*Date:* 2022-02-13

After killing Strahd, the group desperately tried to escape the mines as it stated to destroy itself around them. They managed to escape but now separated from one another.

* Dwight showed up in the mine and saw a wall explode with a ancient dwarf running out, followed by a creature known as The Beholder
* He snapped Ireena out her trance, who had next to no memories of had happened
* Everyone scrambled for the exit as the Beholder's magic on the mine started making it grow and change shape
* First Xerus, Zuileika and Cuddles managed to get through the door and found themselves outside the marsh of the ruines of Berez
* The mines shifted again and the door dissapeared into the floor behind Xerus
* Godfrey summoned a Gold Dragon named Sedring to aide everyone else's escape
* Next Zordar, Dwight and Mordankeinen escaped only to found themselves on top of a freezing mountain with The Amber Temple below them
* The Beholder petrified Sedring, though his strength and wisdom was strong and he released himself from the stone
* Sedring grabbed Ireena and Godfrey as he flew through the door, with an ancient dwarf screaming for his life not far behind
* They found themselves as Tser Falls near the encampment where everyone met Madam Eva
* Xerus went back to Krezk, in hopes he would find his friends and met Gorek who was waiting in the Baron's cottage
* Dwight and Zordar could not stay the night atop a frozen mountain but saw Dwight's windmill not too far away so they went there to rest
* Godfrey made camp, he only had a day before Sedring would leave him and asked him to go out and search for his friends" data-rh="true"><meta property="og:title" content="Session 34" data-rh="true"><meta property="og:description" content="# Escaping the Mines
