            Hey there, this is a website I use to be able to share info with players. I don't agree that DMs should hide anything from their players, other than spoilers. This is a collection of notes and tools I have created and I hope that my players find some use out of it. I do this as a labour of love and not as a job, so please don't be disheartended if you feel something is wrong or incorrect, instead start a conversation with me on Discord and we can sort it out.
        </p>

        <h2>Players & NPCs</h2>
        <p>This has all the infomation I am willing to share about players and NPCs. If something is missing it will be because the players do not know this infomation. It might not be complete and I have tried to keep it as brief as possible.</p>

        <h2>More to come</h2>
        <p>More things to come, lots more.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Notes</b> I will be rewriting my notes into bullets. This will save me time and I write them down anyway</li>
            <li><b>Shops and services</b> I had this before but I am moving it about. It will list all the things players can take advantage of when they play.</li>
            <li><b>DM notes and tools</b> I have a list of things like rules and certain tools which I have created in order to make my job easier, but also to set expectations for players. This is being moved about as well.</li>
        </ul>
