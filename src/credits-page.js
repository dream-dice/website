        <h2 className='subtitle'>For the Images</h2>
        <p>
            I would like to say thank you to everyone on the internet who has provided images. Some of the images my players have given me and all I have done is turn them into avatars. I did find some banners but it was on pintrest and I have no idea who the original author was. If anyone in the world sees this and thinks "Hey that's my image", give me a shout and I will either say thanks or take it down. It is all fan made and there is no profit to be had on this entire website.

        <h2 className='subtitle'>This Website</h2>
        <p>I made this, if you like it you could drop me an email <a href='mailto:lukejpreston@gmail.com'>Luke</a>. I will be honest, I doubt I will respond and I have an aggressive spam filter, but that shouldn't stop you from trying to get in touch.</p>
        <h2 className='subtitle'>My Players</h2>
