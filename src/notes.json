            "The Beholder petrified Sedring, though his strength and wisdom was strong and he released himself from the stone",
            "Sedring grabbed Ireena and Godfrey as he flew through the door, with an ancient dwarf screaming for his life not far behind",
            "They found themselves as Tser Falls near the encampment where everyone met Madam Eva",
