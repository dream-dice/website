# Turning Evil

*Date:* 2022-06-04

While exploring the Amber Temple, Zordar and Gorek take on more dark gifts.

* Gorek and Zuleika went back to the library and found a blueprint to create a spear for Zuleika naming it Auld Stoney.
* Everyone tried to get into a hidden room next to the library, causing a cave-in.
* The group found another room full of sarcophagi and a Slaad.
* After dealing with the Slaad, Gorek and Zordar accepted two gifts, one who gave them more resilience but made them hairy and the other giving them extreme strangth but turned them into bullies.
* Gorek was not able to resist the dark gift, corrupting his soul and making him evil.
* The group went to rest in an old bedroom for a short while.
