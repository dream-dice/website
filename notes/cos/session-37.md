# Stepping into the Amber Temple

*Date:* 2022-03-12

The group escaped the clutches of the giant birds only to find themselves face-to-face with Rahadin

* The group, stuck inside a tower, decided to divide into two. Half went onto the roof to attack the giant bird in the sky, and half went to attack the one on the ground.
* Kasimir flew into the sky to save Gorek from falling to his death while Dwight finished the monster in the sky with his bow.
* The group made their way to the Amber Temple and saw Rahadin run inside. Godfrey the Vengeful with some of the group charged to chase down Rahadin.
* Some of the party found a crack in the wall to the west of the temple and fled after seeing several large and angry people with a giant wolf.
* They found Rahadin praying at a giant statue of a wizard, sacrificing a frog, and then turned to attack the group, almost wiping out Zuleika with a single attack.
* Rahadin told Kasamir that he wanted him dead so that he and his sister, Patricia, could take over Barovia. Kasimir said he would do anything to save his sister.
* The group killed Rahadin, then Godfrey prayed to Helm, who managed to contact him, telling him to find the weapon in the temple and be wary of a Lich.
