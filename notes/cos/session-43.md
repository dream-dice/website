# Trapped Beneath Vallaki

*Date:* 2022-06-04

The group found themselves trapped underneath The Seven HQ.

* Zordar explained to Kasimir that his sister was not a vampire and had planned to kill Ezmerelda and attack him. Something he learned from the Hag in the Windmill.
* Goatku said he was going to try and right some wrongs and help the people of Vallaki. Now that Izek was 'dead,' he felt capable of looking after the town.
* They slowly traveled back to Krezk to get ahead of Patrina.
* When they arrived, Dimitri didn't recognize Zordar, mistaking him for a werewolf.
* Dimitri told the group that The Abbot was dead and the Mongrelfolk had marched into town. He wasn't sure what to do.
* One of the Mongrelfolk said that 'Mother' was waiting inside one of the homes.
* Entering the home, they found Vasilka, the bride that The Abbot had made for Strahd.
* She explained that she had got married, and as a wedding gift, Strahd gave her Krezk.
* Dimitri came running inside and told them that Patrina had shown up and he needed their help.
* Outside Patrina had charmed Kasimir and brought several vampires to attack the town.
* She also convinced Vasilka that Strahd wanted her to attack the town.
* During the fight, Dimitri died, and afterward, Anna, his wife, kicked the group out of Krezk and told them they were never allowed back in.
* During the fight, Dimitri died. Anna, Dimitri's wife, kicked the group out of Krezk and told them they were never allowed back in seeing how they had destroyed Dimitri's body.
* Kasimir took his dead sister to the Amber Temple in hopes that he would bring her back to life.
* Zordar promised to be the father of the Mongrelfolk, and the group gained a new ally named Manny.
* The group stopped off at Kazan's Tower to rest and talk to Ireena before going to Vallaki.
* Ireena said she was bored. Zordar and Xerus offered to escort her to Vallaki so she could do some shopping.
* The group met Goatku outside, who had joined the guard. He said he would go find Ronaldo and bring him to them.
* After doing some shopping, the group went to The Seven HQ with Ronaldo for the meal he had promised in a letter sent to Godfrey.
* While there, Zordar smashed the dining table after hearing noises underground, and together they descended a secret trapdoor.
* Ronaldo closed the door behind them and locked them inside.
* Ronaldo told them that Strahd had told him to lock them inside until nightfall or he would kill the orphans he cared for.
* The mysterious screaming turned out to be a specter that was only there as a distraction.
