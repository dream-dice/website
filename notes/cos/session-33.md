# Removing the Curse

*Date:* 2022-01-29

They gave the wedding dress to The Abbot who told them to bring Ireena to him at dusk to perform the ritual. When they went to get her they found Strahd in the mines.

* The Abbot told them that once the ritual was done Ireena would no longer be connected to Strahd
* He would try to convince Strahd to marry the bride he made for him in order to buy the group some time
* The Abbot mentioned that if Ireena should die then Strahd would bring a force more powerful on the group than anything they could handle
* When they entered the mines they found Ireena chanting and unresponsive
* As they rounded the corner Strahd had Mordankeinen and forced her to trigger the Gottrison's defences
* Strahd said that he would marry Ireena and then destroy Barovia in order to start all over again
* The group killed Strahd, the Holy Symbol of Ravenloft proved instrumental in his defeat
