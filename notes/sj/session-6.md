# Attack in the Prison bay

* After laying a trap to clear out all tiny Beholderlings you tried to trick the remaining two into accepting your copy.
* They fight over who should get the shiny one and catch you trying to steal the real one.
* They call the Ogre to come fight, and with another trap you kill both Beholderlings, leaving Hiplomus trapped with an Ogre
* Whether luck or the sheer stupidity of the Ogre you manage to rescue Hiplomus and head back to the Academy
* On the way, a Githyanki boards the Tyrant ship demanding where Miken is and eventually learns he has been taken to the Academy
* He escapes and vows that he will bring he rest of his crew to the Academy
* After a week where everyone finally appreciates you and your efforts, pirates attack the Academy
* You rush to the prison bay and find they have taken Miken
* You come face-to-face with several Giffs who are hungry for violence
