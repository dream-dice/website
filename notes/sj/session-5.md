# Officer Down

* After installing the Helm and resting an explosion on board the ship occurs and a fire breaks out.
* You rush upstairs and find several Fire Magmims have been summoned and are spreading fire on the ship.
* While putting out the ire you discover that Officer Winston has been killed in the fire.
* With the help of the violent Krik'let you interrogate Miken and learn he is the one behind the recent "mishaps" at the Academy.
* He reveals he was blackmailed by bandits to take down the Academy.
* Krik'let, Pffft, and Valentine take Miken aboard the Hammerhead ship and return to the Academy to lock Miken away.
* Leaving Wizpop behind you land on H'Catha and find that the meteor has been dragged into a cave by an Ogre and several varying kinds of Beholderlings who appear to be silently arguing over it
