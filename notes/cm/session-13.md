# Leaving the High Forest Village

*Date:* 2022-05-30

The group stop Dr Gast and meet Mardyk to help with his request.

* After attempting to steal Dr. Gast's notebook, Firewatch, Cassandra and Cloud fought down Dr. Gast to stop her from harming Killmouis anymore.
* Florian disguised himself as a Mite and searched for the mites which had disappeared down a corridor.
* Firewatch charmed Dr. Gast and tricked her while Cloud and Cassandra attacked from behind.
* After defeating her, Timagast read her notebook.
* Dr. Gast had failed several times to heal the Killmouis, which corrupted her soul over time. So she decided to turn all Killmouis into Mites.
* The group reported back to the tavern where Wedge, Jesse, and Biggs were grateful for their help.
* Chocobo Bill offered them a place to stay and food, so long as they helped look after the new baby Chocobos.
* The group played with the Chocobos and enjoyed the rest of their stay in the High Forest.
* Word spread of their good deeds and how friendly they were with the Chocobos.
* The next day, they met Mardyk and showed him the letter from the Scarlet Sash.
* Mardyk asked that they helped save his patron Zybilna and explained how amazing she was.
* This explanation brought back memories of when a beautiful woman in a long blue gown had helped them as a child, and now realized this was Zybilna.
* Mardyk said that if they found Zybilna, who was last seen at the Feywild Carnival, he would give them everything inside his chest.
* As the group arrived at the mushroom circle, Timagast recanted a story about eating mushrooms, that took him to a different plane of existence.
* They stepped into the circle and found themselves at a Carnival.
