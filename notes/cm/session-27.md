# Meeting Wil of the Feywild

*Date:* 2023-02-04T20:30:00.000Z

The group met Wil and received the Lore of Lure.

* As the group left they rested. Timagast struggled to sleep, but Cassandra could not get any rest as a knight ghost kept waking her and any sleep she got was also troubled.
* On the way to Loomlurch the group found Red XIII and played a game of Liar. Red XIII told them that Cloud's old friend Tifa was looking for hunters killing animals in the High Forest and had gone to Little Oak to get more information and get into the Wayward Pool.
* Cloud could sense someone was following them, so the group set a trap for the hunter.
* The group caught the hunter and killed her, they suspected that she was a Werewolf. Timagast had tricked Jill into getting engaged with him and so they preserved the body for ten days in hopes to bring her back to life.
* The group changed their direction and went to Little Oak where they met Wil of the Feywild and his gang who had all been saved from Skabatha.
* Wil told them how Skabatha trapped children and got them to make toys and sweets to sell in her market at Loomlurch. He then told them his plan to save the children from Skabatha.
* Cloud heard a noise from Wil's bag and they found a book named the Lore of Lure with a picture of a unicorn on it. The book told them to look in the back and they found an extract from Cloud's book, An Incomplete Wiki of Flora and Fauna about unicorn's A.K.A "Female Unicorns".
* The book told them that Tifa couldn't open the book but head out to Dewight to find a way into the Wayward Pool trying to save a corrupt beast. The children gave the group a pantomime unicorn outfit and said that this was the only way into the Wayward Pool.
