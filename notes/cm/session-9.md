# Tracking Freyot

*Date:* 2022-03-21

After returning to Candlekeep Freyot killed again, and the hunt was on.

* Little One explained that another person has been killed.
* Firewatch received a letter from Glenny, Matreous's mother explaining that Freyot had open three rooms in the Hearth.
* Together they found the keys for the three rooms, and Florian reached under the elevator freeing them from the house of rest.
* The first room was a hoard of books, all about Myiirm, the dragon who started their hoard with Janussi when Candlekeep was    .
* The next room contained a Dragonborn named Ernest, Freyots dragon speaker.
* Ernest explained that Freyot had created four illusions to get around Candlekeep. Francis, with no voice. Matreous, now dead. Lirial, now exiled. Pittacus was the fourth illusion.
* The last room contained several tunnels acting as portals to the whole of Candlekeep.
* The group took Janussi to meet Ernest to prove that Freyot is planning on taking over the hoard and that Pittacus is an illusion.
* Back in The Hearth Pittacus was there, the illusion broken, showing the emerald dragon in their true form. Freyot fled towards the Grand Library by burrowing.
* In light of this, Jannusi gave Firewatch a key to the Grand Library and said she would get back up while they chased down the dragon.
