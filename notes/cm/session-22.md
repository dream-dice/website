*Date:* 2022-10-17T20:30:00.000Z

The group helped King Muckstump enforce his laws.

* With an army in toe, the group entered the Bavlorna's cottage in the middle of Downfall's murky lake.
* They killed an Ooze coming out of a well in the bottom of the house.
* After fighting several creatures wearing hats, they managed to find Bavlorna.
* Bavlorna was having a cup of tea with Charm.
* While Charm did now speak, he shared several knowing looks with the group.
* Bavlorna agreed that if the group retrieved her taxidermy, the Bavlorna's Big Book of the Bad, and dispatched the Ooze in the well, she would give them Octavian's heart, a head for Clapperclaw, and they could speak with Zybilna.
* While the army went to retrieve the items, the group met a Redcapp where Florian made an exquisite meal, and Fireatch tried his best.
