# Saving Charlie the Unicorn

The corrupted unicorn fight continues

* As the unicorn was damaged, it was revealed to be Florian's horse Charlie.
* Charlie had turned into a real unicorn when the group entered the Feywild at the Carnival.
* The god, Malar, has corrupted Charlie to give the hunters an ultimate challenge to capture it.
* After the unicorn sustained a large amount of damage the hunters were stopped by the group.
* The hand of Malar came from the ground to claim the hunter's soul for failing their hunt.
* Cassandra lit the cauldron in the center of the pool and everyone waited an hour in the waters.
* Cassandra's curses were lifted
    * Her contract with the Scarlet Sash was torn up as her Wereraven curse was lifted
    * Her dexterity bonus was removed and her dreams restored
    * The ghost haunting her for taking Nib's gold left
    * The poem from Shemshimes Rhyme had subsided
* Timagast's curse was lifted and his constitution reduced and dreams restored
* Charlie's curse was lifted, his horn was snapped and broken
* Charlie told the group about his boyfriend Elidon who had been captured by Skabatha and had his horn stolen. He pleaded with the group to save him and bring him back to the lake
* The book told the group that Cloud saw Tifa's tracks just beyond the fog heading toward Little Oak where Wil waited for the group
* It also told of how Timagast looked up and saw Charm's Weather Balloon on a mountaintop
* The group when to the balloon and followed a 5-year-old goblin child who had bought a crab shell from Charm
* The group was unconvinced of the child's innocent motives to turn the crab shell into a frisbee to play a game where the winner would get to eat the candied crab shell
* They chased the child, forced them to play the game
* The child, in fear of their life from five strangers forcing them to play a game, poisoned the frisbee
* Casandra managed to let the child win and forced them to eat the poison frisbee
* As he did so, it exploded in his hands causing great pain to Cassandra, Zybilna's voice ringing in the forest, "No one shall harm a child in Prismeer"
* The group appologied and went back to the balloon for a spot of shopping
