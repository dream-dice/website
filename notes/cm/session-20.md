# Downfall Revolution

*Date:* 2022-09-19

The group helped Muckstump in his revolution against King Gullop XIX.

* With several hours before midnight, the group went to explore Downfall.
* You met an elf named Octavian Meliamne who was missing his heart and asked if you would retrieve it from Bavlorna for him. You all agreed, and he promised to give you his pipes on your return.
* Several sprites attacked Buzzy and goaded everyone into a fight with a Tree Blight. During the fight, one of the clotheslines connected to Bavlorna's Cottage broke.
* Everyone quickly ran away and encountered a cauldron. The hot coals underneath exchanged the passed to open the cauldron for some wood.
* Chip turned into a giant toad after drinking some of the liquid for an hour.
* The group took this opportunity to rest before starting the assault.
* The group managed to kill King Gullop XIX, but almost lost their minds during the fight and were nearly taken prisoner themselves.
* Now the Bullywugs were ruled by King Muckstump XXVII
