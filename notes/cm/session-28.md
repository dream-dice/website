# Hunting the Corrupt Unicorn

After leaving Wil the group went on the hunt and found a corrupt Unicorn in the Wayward Pool

* The book guided the group to Dewight where they met Tifa, who was trying to save the corrupt beast and a pixie that knew a way to do this without killing it
* The pixie told them to light the fire in the Wayward Pool and have the beast stay in there for an hour. They also mentioned two other things. Anyone with a curse could stay in the pool for a minute to lift the curse. It is impossible to light a fire within 1000 feet of the Wayward Pool.
* They left Tifa behind, donned the unicorn outfit and entered the Wayward Pool.
* There they found a corrupt unicorn that was summoning red lightning from its horn and was hiding inside the pool.
* They also met the hunters that copied them, disguising themselves as unicorns to enter.
* The hunters said they did not know who the fake werewolf was that they had killed, someone else must have been hunting the group.
* Eventually the hunters lured the unicorn out, using Timagast as bait.
* The unicorn fought hard to be caught, and during the process turned Timagast into a wolf..
