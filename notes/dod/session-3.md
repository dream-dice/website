# Enter Brimstone Fortress

* Donning various disguises the group entered the fortress
* The walls to the fortress were 120ft high from the lava level and 60ft thick mix of adamantine, obsidian and stone
* A dragon, who was so bored, attacked the group. Anyone who tried to entertain her managed to get past but promised to meet her later to entertain her further.
* They snuck down into the fortress and found the audience chamber guarded
* Each member of the group gave a diamond to see Xerus in the audince chamber
* Vrakir was found talking to Xerus
* The group suspected that Xerus was a different version of himself or somehow different and tried to see if he was in distress
* Failing that, Vrakir, Xerus and the guards started to attack
