# Not Another D&D Blog!

Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I will tell you about myself and why I want to make a public blog. I am DM Luke (not the one from the DM Lair), and it wasn't until the first lockdown in the UK that I started playing D&D regularly and more seriously. Before that, I had played once during my second year at university, after I started running my pen and paper games with only d6's. I didn't play much of anything for a long time after that, other than Munchkin and other card games with the in-laws. As I finished my job at the BBC, I started a hugely successful podcast called Blank String (we peaked at a whopping 11 listeners), where we would randomly play games that only required a d6, and I started my first D&D campaign, which we never finished.

Like most people, I wanted to do something when lockdown happened. So I reached out to my friends and asked who wanted to play D&D. Happily, only one of them had played before, and no one knew the rules. This meant I could do whatever I wanted, and no one told me I was wrong. We are still playing that same Curse of Strahd campaign, and only one player has left due to getting a job overseas with very poor internet availability. I have since started another drive with even more friends, and D&D has become a core part of my life, and I'd consider it my main hobby.

## Why Am I Writing a Blog?

I have a little book given to me by one of my players. Almost every session, I write in it. It isn't always bad things; it is often just thoughts about a topic from the session. When I look online, it is rare to see content from DM's who only talk about playing remote. This is what I want to focus on, how I have learned to play remote successfully and how I feel about certain topics. It will be my opinion, inspired by my little book.

If this blog helps anyone, that is a plus. If you read this blog and hate everything about, that is fine. I am not planning to share this blog with anyone or get any kind of comments from the wider D&D community. This blog is for me to get content out of my brain and maybe there is someone out there who will have as much fun and passion for D&D as I have and they might just enjoy this blog, and that sounds good enough a reason to me to make it public.

## What I Plan to Write About

As I said, mostly online related things. I want to talk about Virtual Table Top systems, about ways to setup your games online for success (or ways to avoid failure), how certain parts of the Dungeon Master's Guide fails people in the modern age, that Reddit, YouTube and this blog are not the fountain of all things good and holy, and to just talk about things that happen in my games which other might learn from or relate to.

I do not have a plan when I will release them and I have no finite list. I want to keep playing D&D for as long as I can and perhaps this blog will just stop one day, or there will be a huge gap in time.

I would like to turn some of these into YouTube videos or a podcast series. Being honest, I don't have time for that, and I am afraid that everyone online will be abusive toward me or that I am opening myself up to criticism that I don't want to hear. So with that, feel free to share this blog with anyone. I might have some points you like/dislike and that you'd like to share with the rest of your friends. Unless you want me to try out a new online tool or play a game with you, please don't get in-touch, as I won't respond and will just block you and the conversation.
