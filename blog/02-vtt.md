# Virtual Table Top (or VTT)

I have tried quite a few VTT's and a few different ways to play D&D. This seems like a hot loaded subject with lots of people gathering behind their favourite VTT for the job. I am VTT agnostic (and generally agnostic of all D&D related tools) and I implore everyone should be as well. Most of my content is backed up in Google somewhere or available in some format that does not require any VTT. This means when a new and better tool comes out I can swap over, try it out, and my players and I enjoy it we can swap without any resistence.

In this blog I want to talk high level about the tools I have used and my progression with them. It is a vert strange list and by no means conclusive. I am always look for new tools and always get excited by new toys!

## Discord Calls

So it started in a blog and I did Theatre of the Mind (TTM) games. I had a lot of fun with these, but they are probably the most draining way to play D&D. You have to always be imagining things and using a lot of imrpov compared to modern VTT. You have to throw away most of the DMG and Players Handbook and be happy for things to slide. Here are some tips I would give for anyone who wants to play TTM only

* **Don't** have a map - it doesn't work and slows the game down, often with the DM forgetting to say what they see or getting frustrated that players keep asking "What's going on?"
* **Do** have sketches of maps, rough drawings, and notes so long as you don't track distance, ammunition or stealth - trying to track these always results in players getting confused and frustrated
* For the purposes of keeping everything audio only, throw all your unique details in the bin. Your players can not see it, and they won't appreciate a monologue from you describing it. I have delivered games where I got into a lot of detail only to have players unable to parse that detail.
* Where a module has a block of text you are meant to describe, **don't** read it out. There is too much infomation in those things and you are better off describing everything yourself. These things are assumed to be accompanied with a map or visual stimuli and never work on their own
* **Always** improv, it is easier to improv an audio session and more fun that trying to read scripts. It requires you knowing how to improv in D&D and that is not an easy thing to do. However, doing the classic "Just give me a minute while I read my notes" is never fun to listen to. At least with a map or something visual it keeps players entertained while you find your notes. If you improv, then your notes don't matter. You just need the mental capacity to remember all your details and requires more prep in my opinion than visual games
* **No** visual puzzles. It's a pain to try and solve these kinds of puzzles
* **Do not** play music. No one can hear you or each other while you play music. I like my players being able to decide if they want to listen to the music I am playing, and Discord doesn't have good tools for this. The effort of getting audio working with TTM just isn't worth the payout.
* If you share anything, only share still images and not maps or puzzles. It is too hard for players to conceptualise anything other than "Here is a pic of the bar maid who takes your order" or "I found an awesome picture of the castle here"

I have had a lot of fun with these, but it took too much energy for me and I can only imagine my players switched off or did something else without telling me. 

## Figma

This is an odd one but it was my first VTT I tried. If it wasn't for the fact that the tool is meant for designers it was my favourite solution. Figma is really quick, lets you do ANYTHING you like and isn't resource intensive. However, it is mega complex and my players who hadn't used it before had no way of working out how to use it. It was good seeing players cursors and I could crop maps or hide them with big squares to reveal them as the players moved around the game. All of this was a lot of work, and draining telling players how to use the very complex tool. If I had a group of people who all had used Figma in the past, I would be very tempted to go back to it.

There are alternatives which might fit the bill that are similar, like Miro or FigJam. The latter means you'd be able to share your assets from your main Figma file to the game. I haven't tried these but I would be keen to try.

## Roll20

I tried Roll20 free tier but decided I didn't want to play games with it. It's so ugly and slow. The interface isn't intuitive and the free tier doesn't allow very much to make me think a paid for version is any better. That said, it is very popular and the community around Roll20 is very active. Most people sort issues using extensions. I had another look recently and it hasn't changed in over a year. I think that says a lot about the tool. They are happy to take your subscription but for whatever reason aren't using that money to make Roll20 better.

As a player, the music always sounds bad, the video always breaks and I can never hear anyone on the calls. It takes a lot away from the game when you can't hear or talk to your players. With that I suggest you find a video conference tool that works for everyone. The other advantage to that is, if the DM has to restart the game or do something that will stop the video or audio they are still on the call. You can also join a call using your phone, so if your computer is garbage you can at least join the call part and just ask your DM or someone to share their screen.

You'd think they would have solved the problems, I just don't understand what they do with their money that they can't solve all the problems. They must have bucket loads of money.

## Foundry VTT

This is my current solution. Once I learned how to make a game in FVTT I just fell in love with it. It isn't easy to make a game. FVTT is so resource hungry it is scary. Some players experience a terrible time playing on it, however I have managed to get by with it. I don't know if they are having a bad time and just not saying anything or having a bad time and not knowing, or that they don't want to hurt my feelings. It is really hard to know what someone is experiencing. The character sheets in FVTT could be better, but they aren't that bad. I use DDB Importer to get all my DDB content and get the players across. I finally got the players to leave DDB and play in FVTT which has made the games so much smoother.

The music seems to work really well since version 9. Prior to that it would crash some people's machines. I can control how quiet it is for me and my players can control it too. I have said, if no one is listening this is find, but let me know because it is effort I don't need to put in if they aren't enjoying it.

You can have videos as your background. I would suggest you remove the audio and have the audio run in a playlist. It works so much better than having it part of the video and loads quicker (not a lot quicker but quicker is quicker). Videos shouldn't be very long and shouldn't be very large. Like 15s loop is max, no one cares if the bird makes it all away across the huge map. I would advice you don't need 4k videos. They take a lot of memory and space, and most players don't have 4k monitors to even enjoy the map or they have garbage machines which crash when they try to use them. If you can compress them to 1080p or if 720p has good enough quality then do that. 720p isn't great but means the games load up fast.

Try to make all your assets small as possible. Loading is a pain and most players apparently have McDonalds WiFi.

Happily, my players have managed to get a setup where they can enjoy FVTT. I am looking for something with similar features but less intense.

I have loads of thoughts on how you can utilise FVTT to make a really smooth and amazing experience for DMing. Expect a lot more blogs on this!

## Owlbear

Hot damn I love this! If it had the features of FVTT I think are important I would swap over in a heartbeat. It doesn't have notes, which is really important. It doesn't have character sheets, meaning you have to have DDB open as well as a video call. Not everyone has a second 1440p monitor like me, and a large tablet... So small screens with lots of windows is a killer experience.

However, if you want to get started in D&D I would suggest you use this first. Then migrate to another tool like FVTT or Roll20

## Screen Sharing (like with Google Meet or Zoom)

I haven't tried this very often, mainly in my session 0 when we create characters. However, I think it has legs. So long as you aren't running maps with screenshare. I can only imagine how annoying it would be as a player to be like "I want to move there, no there, no 5 foot to the right, I didn't want to trip the trap, you forced me to do that". Perhaps TTM and visual aide is good here.

## Let's Roll

This is still in beta but I think it is great. It is better than Roll20 but not as feature rich as FVTT. I will give it another look and I think I might switch. Maintaining FVTT is a pain

## One Shot All The Tools

There are loads, none of them solve everything and it can get really frustrating. I advice you run a one shot to assess whether a tool is good before diving in. Do not be detered by a bad session due to technical faults. Sometimes it is about finding the right balance. For instance FVTT can't handle large maps, so I have trimmed the ones I make down. I had modules that worked, but then they broke so I removed them.
