# The Perfect Virtual Tabletop

This is a biased thing for me which would make something the perfect VTT. I don't think anyone has hit the nail on the head yet but there you go.

## Tokens

Token are awesome. Some things which tokens need.

* I don't think we need vision collision. It slows things down quite a bit. What would be easier it just some sort of toggable circle which shows someone the range that they can see in the dark.
* You need to be able to quickly see stats about your players, FVTT has a nice module which lets you right click on a token and it shows you the stats.
* An easy to setup, status effect. I don't mean, here is a list of prefab statuses. You type the name of the status, perhaps it could use that to guess an icon, but it is probably easy to let someone pick and upload icons for status effects. There are so many status effects and making a pre defined list just isn't important. I do think a user saving some to quickly toggle would be alright.
* The distance they can travel would be really helpful and being able to drag them around to see the distance is useful. There will be something about rulers later

## Character sheets

Character sheets just haven't been solved. I am not surprised since they can be so complex and different for everyone. However, I do think it should be possible to make a character sheet which works and doesn't require you to do super complex actions.

* Drag and drop, there is a module for this in FVTT which lets you drag and drop things onto character sheets. It is so nice just to be like "Here you go, here is you item" and drop it onto their character sheet or put it in the chat so they can put it on their own character sheet.
* In some ways FVTT has character sheets good, but loads of things are hidden from players and it isn't obvious. There is a module which makes this better but it is still hard. There needs to be a tab of "Actions|Bonus|Reaction|Special|Features" which are the raw things and jumbles up all the spells, attacks, items and everything from a character that they can do.
* It is suprising to me that spells, items, and features are all treated different. They are all the same thing but with different names. I feel like an API which just lets you generate all these would be great.
* A compandium of everything you can put on a character or NPC sheet. Doesn't matter if it is somehting small like "Darkvision 60" or large like a complex feature. It should also include things like "Rock" an attack from a monster.
