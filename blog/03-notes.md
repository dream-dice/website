# Notes

This is a two part thing. Taking notes and sharing notes.

## Taking Notes

I don't do this during a session unless it is important. I write lots of notes between sessions, I then throw them away and write them again. I find this is a great way to remember my notes and often, having the old notes means I don't evolve my game for the better. You should write notes after a session, but wait a day or two. You want to absorb everything that happened. If you want too long then you forget. Reflecting on what happened often results in awesome story writing and creates great inspiration to improve your game.

I think not taking any notes is a recipe for disaster. I can only imagine that if you forget, your players will forget and the game will just fall to pieces. If you rely souly on a module for notes, you will inevitably flick through the module at a speed which is slows the game down, and miss lots of important points.

Keep your notes short and brief, bullets are essential.

## Note Taking Tools

Don't use paper, that's gross. Think about the trees! I am joking, paper is totally fine but digital tools make note taking so much easier.

I write my notes using Markdown, because I am a freaking nerd. I don't expect this to be a typical case. The advantage to this means, I can use any tool and just write markdown.

Grammarly is the greatest tool for grammar anyone has ever invented. It works with most online solutions (including FVTT)

Google has amazing set of tools for taking notes where you can reference other documents. You can use spreadsheets for time management, for resources, for tavern menus, for shop inventories. You can use the plain old docs for things. The presentation can be used for mapping out ideas and flows of games. What I am saying is, there is a huge suite of free tools from Google that you can take advantage of... FOR FREE.

FigJam and Miro are so good for brain maps. You can fill them full of post its and images then you can keep track of things like "If the players do this, then I will respond with this". I strongly reccomend you try this out, it is so awesome.

You might have noticed I haven't mentioned FVTT or Roll20 for notes. They are not very good tools for recording notes I feel. They are good for keeping notes of the game you are playing and for images to share with your players. However, writing notes just doesn't work well enough. If you use Google then you can be VTT agnostic. I do reccomend that you copy, yourself and not with a tool like DDB Adventure Muncher, notes from a module into your VTT. It means I actually read the notes, I know where they are and I can modifiy them to the way I run the game. I will have a whole blog on this for FVTT specifically as I have great techniques for this.

## Player Notes

You might have noticed that I have notes for my players on this website. I 100% think you should share session notes with players. It doesn't need to be on a website like this. You could have a whole google folder for players where you share what happend, what players are doing next and why they are doing it.

Players don't take notes. Any that do don't take good notes. It is so damn frustrating that it makes me want to scream at them and choke them to death... So instead I take notes and share them with my players. I now automate a little thing in FVTT which says what they just did, what they are going to do, and why they are doing any of it. I suggest you do something similar, keep a google doc which you update before each session and share it at the start. Then you tell your players it is their fault if "important" details go missing. If I don't record it and they don't record it, consider it non-important. I don't record how they want their player to evolve, that's their thing and most of the time they just wing it.

I have started to include dates of things which I am willing to share with my players, like the date when an event will happen or how long a curse or effect will last. It helps both of us.

I was writing a whole section on notes of NPCs and players. I stopped doing this in favor of adding names to tokens. Somehow, adding names to tokens everyone just remembers it. I don't know why. It might just be me.

If players forget something here is what I now do. "I did write it down, and I think your player would remember... insert railroading memories...". They don't remember, and being a jerk DM "YOU SHOULD HAVE TAKEN NOTES!" only ruins the game. I don't like railroading players, but if they forget something I need to tell them what they should have remembered and answer questions as calmly and happily as I can which ultimatly forces them to do a thing or they just go off the rails and go against what they previously said, which is a dick move and only trolly players who want to ruin a game would do this. Sure, it is through gritted teeth and the subtext is "Why can't you just remember, I have so many things to do, I don't need to remember everything for you" but I would rather play D&D and do this job for them.

There is very little I don't share with my players, I am very open an honest about most if not all my games.
