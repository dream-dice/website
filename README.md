# Dream Dice, a.k.a Intrepid Crusaders

The code is for a website with my notes for my players.

It is for my creative purposes only.

Appendix
    - the new reading
    - the old reading
Characters
    - There is probably an update to many Characters in CoS
    - I am probably missing loads of characters, but I don't really have the patients to go through all of them

If I add all the notes to FVTT then I will know who/what is misiing. Shouldn't be too hard right?

I think that takes priority over this. The other thing I could do is DDB munch, though it wasn't that great las time and I redid the whole thing anyway
I also need to get the amber temple setup for CoS session




"Mother,

I have been duped into doing something I ought not to, and if I caught, there would be little evidence to prove my innocence and lead to my exile.

A person named Freyot approached me and pointed out that the private chambers you can rent at The Hearth aren't strictly confidential since the mages can detect if anyone is defiling any works from the archive. They can instantly close it down and arrest the people inside. I changed the formula for the rooms, and now no one can detect anything from the inside or out.

After this, Freyot disappeared without a trace. I wanted to continue our discourse around their interest in other facilities in Candlekeep, and perhaps we could lobby for different ways to improve them.

It wasn't long after this that I discovered several rooms had been rented out and that no one had closed them or had paid their tab. I fear this Freyot individual has rented out rooms to conduct illicit activities. However, all the rooms are booked under my name. I have paid for the remaining tab, but we can not access these rooms. It would appear that the keys for these rooms have no longer existed.

I have paid for these rooms to be open for six months. I hope to find the keys in the meantime.

If someone finds the keys and something horrible has happened inside these rooms, I am sure to be blamed unless I can find Freyot and force a confession. Fistandia referred Freyot to me after sharing valuable information to further her research into Magical Mansions. I will endeavour to talk with Fistandia and see whether she knows how I can find Freyot.

Fining Freyot appears to be a fruitless task. Would you please ready my room in six months, no doubt, when I am caught for some heinous act and exiled from Candlekeep.

Warmest regards, Matreous."

"Dear Firewatch,

Thank you for your letter, my Matreous was a charming man. His death was a shock to us all and we miss him deeply.


I received this letter after Matreous had passed away. Post can take weeks to arrive this side of Farun. Before receiving your letter, I intended to send this Janussi. I fear she might accuse him of lying to me. She is particularly blunt and rude, especially if you consider how she is the Keeper of Tomes, you'd think she would be wiser. I hope that you and your friends will be able to help clear Matreous's name. Ge always tried to make Candlekeep a better place for people to live and work.

Warmest regards, Glenny"
