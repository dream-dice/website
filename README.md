# Dream Dice, a.k.a Intrepid Crusaders

The code is for a website with my notes for my players.

It is for my creative purposes only.

# Todo

Appendix
    - the new reading
    - the old reading
Characters
    - There is probably an update to many Characters in CoS
    - I am probably missing loads of characters, but I don't really have the patients to go through all of them

If I add all the notes to FVTT then I will know who/what is misiing. Shouldn't be too hard right?

I think that takes priority over this. The other thing I could do is DDB munch, though it wasn't that great las time and I redid the whole thing anyway
I also need to get the amber temple setup for CoS session
