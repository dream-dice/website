# Frost and Smoke

The group gathered at the mouth of the werewolf den to prepare for the ambush heading their way. They felt confident with the upper hand. This confidence was not to last.

I heard a tapping at the window. A raven stood outside and kept tapping at the window. I pulled the window open, and the raven hoped inside. Attached to its leg was a rolled-up note.

> Your friends are in great danger as the wolves march north

I quickly took my leave and gathered everything I needed to see what help I could offer. I left the walls of Vallki and started tracking down wolves. The werewolves in Barovia, under the order of Strahd, gather individuals and make them fight. The winner of these fights is turned into a werewolf and made to join the pack. They are often hard to track and trace and are clever as to who they steal. Perhaps not so wise this time as I quickly found where they were headed and caught up to them fast.

Whilst I was moving as fast as I could, all but Zordar were inside preparing for the coming ambush. However, they did not realise that a particularly dangerous werewolf was sneaking in on them and squeezed in through a hole in the top of the cave. It snuck up behind them and attacked them by surprise.

The group fought back, but as they did so, the cold came in from the south, making it hard to breathe. From the top of the cave, thick smoke filled the air making it impossible to sense who or what was hidden within.

The werewolves had surrounded the group and charged forward. I saw Zordar and Parriwimple tied up and abandoned on the floor outside. My dear friend Zordar, bearly holding on for dear life, freed himself, and I healed him so that we may turn the tide of this battle from the outside.

I saw several arrows fly out of the cave and head up to the top. It wasn't until afterwards that I realised Dwight was using his Oathbow to target Kiril, the pack leader. An arrow struck him, and he ordered all the wolves and werewolves to surround him and protect him from this invisible enemy.

The battle raged on. Arty took the form of a Tyrannosaurus and attacked the Winter wolf that entered the cave bringing the frost with it. The others fought the dangerous werewolf inside, but not before he sunk his teeth into Gorek, Godfrey and Xerus, cursing them with lycanthropy.

The fight carried on for some time as the frost and smoke drew closer and closer, enclosing the group.
