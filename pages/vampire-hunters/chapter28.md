# Zuleika's Prayer

When Zordar awoke, he saw that several werewolves had joined the group, as well as a large number of wolves. As he was looking around, a werewolf put a sack over his head and carried him away. Just as the bag was blinding him, he saw his trusty great axe on the back of a wolf and longed for the moment he could take it in his hand and chop off the heads of his captors.

The echos of Madam Eva's card reading rang in their heads

> This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness. Beast, a werewolf, holds the secret hatred for your enemy. Use her hatred to your advantage.

The adventurers crept through the secret door. The cave was quiet, and when they got to the bottom, they came across a curtain made of human skin. Dwight crept forward and saw two wolves asleep huddled around each other, a cub and an older wolf. Instead of waking them, they moved around the cave to see what else they could find before making a plan of attack.

The cave floor was littered with bones. These posed no threat to the stealthy Dwight, who was so silent he didn't even wake the sizeable white wolf asleep nearby. Lykaios could smell that she was a strong female werewolf. Xerus came across a cavern where he heard muttering inside. A woman knelt by a statue and prayed. The figure was a tall statue of a woman with the head of a wolf, Mother Night. She arose and asked who was there. The woman was named Zuleika and said to them that she believed Mother Night had answered her prayers. It couldn't be a coincidence that these strangers should show up as she prayed for her partner's safe return and the end of the werewolf tyranny.

She told them that she wanted to overthrow Strahd and free the werewolves from his hold. Kiril, the Alpha, was unhappy with her recent attitude and ordered her to remain behind during the hunt. Her punishment awaited her on their return. Zuleika said that if they helped her kill Kriril and become the Alpha, she would aid them in their fight against Strahd as she wanted to get to Ravenloft and free Emil.

Zuleika managed to wake Wencensia and Kellen and told them they would protect them if they followed her new friends outside. They agreed, and the ambush was ready. The group made their way to the top of the stairs, and Dwight woke the sleeping white wolf with his bow. Bianca quickly awoke and howled, sounding the alarm, chasing Dwight up the stairs.

Several wolves and werewolves made their way through. Many fell to the spear trap laid at the door. The strategy was a success. After forcing the enemy into a bottleneck, they were easy to pick off from a distance. Bianca fell, and one of the remaining werewolves fled back into the cave. Just as Xerus caught up to her, she bit him, and he was now cursed with Lycanthropy.

Lykaios counted, but there was one less werewolf than there should have been. The adventurers concluded that she must have gone ahead during the fight to tell the other werewolves to come back. Now they had no idea how long it would be before their werewolves were back. Time was of the essence if they didn't too surprised by a mass of werewolves.

Wencensia rewarded the group with two scrolls and thanked them for looking after him and his adopted son. The group broke the cells open and freed the three prisoners. There was a lot to do in a short amount of time. Wencensia took Kellen and the prisoners to Krezk to protect them all. The adventurers remained behind and set about plans to defend the cave and use it as a vantage point against oncoming attackers.
