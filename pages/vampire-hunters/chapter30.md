# A New Pack is Born

In his Tyrannosaurus form, Arty made quick work of the beasts outside, but the werewolf he swallowed fought back, and after regurgitating her up, he lost his concentration and turned back into himself.

Zordar, Parwinple and I destroyed the rest of the werewolves and wolves outside. They were no match for Zordars might Greataxe, in his rage, he chopped them down one by one. Compared to Zordar, I was only able to cause a small amount of damage to the monsters.

In the smoke, Kiril called out, "we only want Zuleika, give her to use, and we will leave you be". A lie, to be sure, and the group continued to fight him. Two Hell Hounds attacked from the smoke, spewing out fire at anyone who was within range.

A werewolf was moving closer, holding a bundle of wood that created the thick smoke. This smoke made no difference to Dwight, who fired his Oathbow at Kiril and knocked him dead. As he fell and shouted, "even Griek's gifts were not enough to stop you, Strahd will have his revenge."

With that, Zuleika was the alpha now. A new age was born of the werewolves. She vowed that no werewolf would hunt humans or follow Strahd's order any more. She was unaware of Griek's magic scroll that allowed the werewolves to summon a Winter Wolf and two Hell Hounds, but the group tamed the remaining Hell Hound. Zuleika kept her promise. She would follow them wherever they went and help them slay Strahd with the hope that they would find and free her love, Emil.

The group took a much needed long rest. They used several scrolls given to them by Wencensia and Arty's magic to cure their Lycanthropy. Xerus decided he would embrace his known gift, and as the night wore on, he could feel his body and soul change, corrupted by the curse. At this point, I took my leave not to raise suspicion in Vallaki and reveal my identity true.

Whilst they were resting, Dwight and Gorek were unable to rest and heal. Every time they slept, visions of people they had hurt or killed kept flashing before their eyes. Nightmares filled their waking moments. It would all come to an end as a woman, in a wolf's head, would bite at them and wake them. Zuleika asked them whether they had been pilfering the treasure hidden behind the statue of the Mother Night at the back of the den. The treasure was cursed. Anyone who took from the hoard would be unable to rest. Arty lifted the curse, and they put the stolen items back. However, it was too late for them to rest any further as it was time to move on to Krezk and remove the curse placed on Ireena by Strahd.

As morning broke and the group were getting ready to move out, an ethereal door opened up. A familiar and terrible face stepped through the door. Griek stepped out and pointed at Arty.

> I have travelled Lambert and have learned that I need a soul to create an unstoppable creature. Arty, somehow, a soul is trapped within your metal frame, and I am here to take it.

A flash of light and Arty instantly fell to the floor from the end of his finger with a loud iron crash. Griek took a flask from his cloak and opened it. A ball of light lept from Arty into the flask. Before anyone could stop Griek he stepped back through the doorway, leaving nothing but echoing laughter in his wake.

Arty was no longer living. The Holy Symbol rolled onto the floor, and three people darted for it. Dwight, Godfrey and Lykaios sprang into motion. It was Lykaios who grabbed it first, and when he did so, he laughed in Dwight's face declaring, "I have won!" He pulled at his face and removed a mask. The illusion melted away to reveal Ka standing with a grin on his face. He threw the Holy Symbol to Dwight. "Remember our deal? When the time comes, I will ask you a favour, and you can not refuse the call ka! When you have finished with Strahd I will need that back to finish my mission. Until them" and Ka took the sky, vanishing out of sight. Dwight handed Godfrey the Holy Symbol and they carried on with their journey.
