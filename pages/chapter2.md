# Chapter 2 - The Durst Manor

Stood outside the grounds the adventurers decided to take a rest by a fire. Whilst doing this they patrolled the grounds and found there was no other way in or out of the manor. Several of them investigated the fog, only to be turned back around. It was as though the house was pulling them in and did not want to them escape.

Whilst they waited another person came from the mist also seeking the werewolves. A Dragonborn Barbarian by the name of Zordar, his red scales burned with the same ferocious intensity as the fire before them. Zordar was a member of the Brawlers faction, a faction dedicated to fighting, violence and drinking. The opportunity to take on a werewolf pack was something Zordar could not wait to sink his sharp dragon teeth into.

As they entered the grounds the group were approached by two children. The older child, Rose, spoke to the group whilst her younger brother clutched tight to her and hid from everyone and everything. They told the group that there was howling inside the house. Gorek tried to convince the children to come with him as he entered the house, but they were too afraid to follow.

The house was old, a painting hangs on the wall. The manor belonged to the Durst family. Gustav was the lord of the manor, standing next to his wife Elizabeth it was clear from the look in their eyes that their children, Rose and Thorn, were disliked and unloved.

As the adventurers made their way through the house they felt its pull on them, haunting them and making them feel uneasy. They could continually hear the faint sound of howling throughout the house.

They made their way to the second floor and found a secret room in the library. The books on the shelves in this room contained horrible necromantic rituals, the texts seem to be written by a mad cult who worship a vampire named Strahd. Dwight came across a note in the hand of a skeleton from Strahd, the note told of how Strahd was not impressed with the cult and their actions to adventurers.

The group went up to the third floor, where they were confronted by a haunted suit of armour that never ceased its attack on them. One room on this floor belonged to a nursemaid whose spectral form attacked them. They found notes in her bedside draw which told of this woman's obsession with Gustav Durst and how tales of how she was going to kill Elizebeth and marry Gustav. In her room, the group found a secret stairway leading up to the attic.
