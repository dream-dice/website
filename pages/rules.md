# My Rules

All GMs have different rules which sit outside of the game's rules. These are mine, intending to make sure everyone is having as much fun as possible.

## Golden Rule

Always have an open conversation with me about **ANYTHING**

## Respect

* Don't ruin the fun for each other
* Don't be a disrespect each other
* I spend a lot of time preparing the game, and some players enjoy spending a lot of time on their characters. Bear that in mind when being a dick

## Sensitive Topics

* Let me know about anything you don't want me to play
* Let me know if something is making you feel uncomfortable
* NPCs might be being offensive and rude, don't take it personally

## Player vs Player (PvP)

* Friendly banter is good
* Fighting each other is bad
* Harming or disrupting players is not OK
* Abusing the rules to troll each other is not OK

Some things I do to help avoid this:

* You can't pocket something secretly
* Money is shared evenly
* All loot is public knowledge
* I will say no if you plan to hurt a fellow adventurer

## No Cheating

* "Oh, that was an accident roll" I am going to make you play the result
* "I forgot to update spell slots and health" I check these to avoid TPK (total party kill) before a session starts

## Character Sheets

* Don't look at each other sheets without asking. They are personal
* Avoid disrupting play to correct a player on a rule. I prefer you wait until after a session and we address it then
* I look at sheets to tailor the game for you
* I won't be updating your sheets for you
* If you want to change race/class/lineage or anything else, let me know

## Secrets

* Secrets from each other is fine
* Secrets from the DM is not fine

## My Final Say

* I have the final say
* I prefer the "rule of cool"
* Feel free to make suggestions on how to run the game

## Non-Player Characters (NPCs)

* If you are abusive to them, they will be abusive back
* Flirting is OK. Harassment is not
* Be respectful to the person(s) behind the NPCs
* Remember there is a human on the other side of the NPC

## If You Can't Make a Session

Life gets in the way sometimes, don't worry. If you can't join, here is what I do:

* I remove your player from the game
* They don't get hurt or die
* There might be a chance for some downtime activities
* I write notes and share them online for everyone to see
* You still get a share of the treasure
* You level up the same as everyone else
* Minimum 2 players to play a game

## 24 Hour Notice

If you can't make it, please let me know as soon as possible. I need the time to change the game. I will do the same so that you can get your time back.

## Discord

* You don't need to interact with Discord if you don't want to
* I will contact you directly if I need something from you
* Tatsu is a bot, and as you use the server, you will level up. The rewards are in-game items and even legendary items. If you level up, let me know, as I might not see it
* Put any Tatsu spam in the Tatsu channel if you are planning to level up. That way, people can ignore it
* Feel free to share anything you like on the server. Everyone is amicable
