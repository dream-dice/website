# Dr Mekal's Journal 499YK

## Day one before leaving

It has been declared that we have one week left in our home before we must leave. We have to prepare all the patients in the lunatic asylum for safe extraction. Most of the people here suffer from gold fever, and sedating them with opiates is enough to stabilise them and let them go free.

I have managed to convince the council that those who suffer from a more perverted brain disease can be managed. One week is all I have to prepare them for the journey into the outside world. I have decided to document these individuals in this journal and will share this with my colleges if I do not make it to our new home.

Evening on the same day

More people came in today with the same symptoms of being homesick. To my dismay, I can not prescribe a long stay at home with the family, it is not safe to stay in these lands with Strahd constantly after our Mythril resources. Instead, I have given them mercury which has been known to give visions of loved ones and family and told them to take it regularly throughout the days after leaving to fight off the longing for home. I fear their hearts will not hold up.

## Day two before leaving

After the siege in the night, many have come in fright. I do not know what they saw during the battle against Strahd but none will talk about it. It is more likely that they are incapable of talking about it. Some of the survivors wish to go back out and fight, I have strict instructions from King Maurdat to sedate these. The clerics have all be given a scroll of Hold Person, though there may not be enough to last the remaining time before we leave.

I have managed to find homes for most of my patients once they leave, carers have kindly taken them in. I have assessed them and I do not fear for their safety. They are all in the hands of capable Dwarves.

There is one patient, Griek, for who I have not been able to find a home. He is a queer fellow to say the least. He has been hearing voices in the walls for some time. At first, I thought he was perhaps homesick, taking in the mine as much as possible before leaving. It seems to transcend this, he is constantly investigating the stone. If I didn't know any better I would say that he is perhaps in love with the stone itself. It is a curious case, if any Dwarf should ever investigate stone as much as he does they should be weary as others may not understand.

Night on the same day

Griek woke me last night with his crying and I have just finished cleaning him up. He soiled himself after seeing his own shadow. He thought it was Strahd sneaking upon him. It took me hours to calm him down. The only way I could do this was to allow him to bottle up his urine to make a `piss grenade` which I can not believe will have any effect, but it quietened him.

## Day three before leaving

A couple who took in Salsal and Lura has been taken to the council for punishment. They came forward saying they would take care of these two children, in turn, they bullied them and mistreated them. The children did not talk after their parents died in battle and their guardians claimed they would take care of them. I hope the council will put them in their place. I now fear for the lives of the others who I have left in the care of those who volunteered to look after the ill. Perhaps this is an isolated incident.

Afternoon on the same day

Brennus and Rhiannnon have been sentenced to stay behind in the mines for their crimes against a fellow Dwarf. They believe they were toughening the children up, instead, they just made things worse. If they weren't such powerful Dwarfs I am sure they would have been exiled or sent to take on Strahd and alone.

As for Griek. He has started collecting small creatures, mainly mice and rats. He started dissecting them. I do not know what knowledge he is claiming to get from this act, it is very strange indeed. I do not see the harm in it however as I was a student once and studied on cadavers. I will observe and see if anything should change.

## Day four before leaving

When I awoke I was horrified to see what Griek had done. He was covered in head to toe in blood when I found him in the morning. He had taken the rats and mice and sewn them together to create a massive King Rat. He was praying to the "Stone gods" to bring life to his creation. He believes that he can create life this way. I do not know for what morbid purpose this is, but if I do not put a stop to it soon he will not be allowed to leave with the others. I am convinced that he can be cured, but whether he can be cured within the remaining 3 days I can not say.

What I plan to do is a role reversal. I will create a horror just the same, and see what he makes of it. Perhaps I will give him my lab coat and some equipment and see him fill the role of a real doctor. I believe this will snap some sense into him as he realizes how bizzare and insane his rituals are.

## Day five before leaving

Griek has been locked up. When the council found him mutating rats they said it was only a matter of time before he changed to larger creatures. He denies that it was him doing this, he believes that it was an experiment to try and awaken him. I feel like the role reversal has caused more damage that it has cured. I consulted the granite deposits and they agreed with council. So we locked him up. I have sewn his mouth shut to not distress the others.

There are two days remaining, I would like to expand my research further on him before we leave his foul corpse to rot in here for all damnation. Since he is been classed as irrademeable I do not think I need any sort of permission to do this, I will keep him locked up in my study and safe from everyone.

## 499Y, Day six before leaving

I have had no choice but to
