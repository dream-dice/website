# Chapter 4 - The Cultist Dungeon

Whilst exploring the dungeon they found two neglected rooms where cultist members would reside. In the middle of this room was a well, with Goreks keen insight into stone he found the well had not only been used for drinking but also as a way to dispose of the remains of those who had come before them.

Arty and Dwight made their way down the hall and found several Ghouls, which they quickly disposed of. Dwight and Godfrey made their way down the hall and found a large bedroom. Whilst investigating the room two Ghasts, Gustav and Elizabeth attacked them. Together with Zordar they took down the monsters, but not before their putrid, rotting bodies could leave a harrowing imprint on each of them in turn during the fight.

Scouting ahead Gorek found yet another floor leading down into a reliquary which housed several artefacts from adventurers who had been lured into this very dungeon only to killed and mutilated by the cult. Whilst he made his way around he found a prison where skeletons in shackles hung against the wall. The repeated chant echoed around the room "He is the Ancient. He is the Land" chilled him and he made a speedy retreat to return to his friends, not daring to go any further on his own.

Arty discovered a room scattered with skeletons home to a large statue holding an orb. He did not detect any magic but failed to see the trap he triggered when he took the orb, suddenly filling the room with shadows that all attacked him at once. He quickly made short work of them, using his magic bestowed upon him by Helm, Gorek ran to his aide to help him from being taken over by the shadows. Gorek then took this opportunity to investigate the room further where he found a secret door with a ladder leading up into the house.

Tired and warn the adventurers sat around a table to discuss their next course of action.
