# The Revolution of Vallaki

The morning was the same as any other when the foul Baron would hold a festival. Depressed and dishevelled people would walk the town square and buy meagre items or start a conversation that would go nowhere. Not one person was capable of speaking up lest they get locked up in the stockade.

The procession carried on, men, women and children marched down the street carrying a flag with the Baron and his wife leading the way. The rain poured down on everyone, making for a most depressing sight. The Baron attempted to light that flag, but to no avail with the pouring rain falling on the flag. After this failed attempt everyone gathered around to watch Xerus and Godfrey put on a show.

Xerus summoned a giant snake, scaring several villagers in the process. The snake lunged forward at Godfrey and he dodged out the way, feining blows back at the snake. Xerus's patron Efreeti told him that if he didn't destroy the town this time he would revoke the magic bestowed upon him, he wanted carnage and mayhem just like the Baron had brought on to the people of Vallaki. When the moment seemed right, Xerus commanded the snake to destroy the stockade and Godfrey quickly scrambled to save the people locked up.

This angered the Baron, he called an immediate halt to the festival and was out for blood. The villagers did not see it this way, it was this symbol of Xerus's that heralded a revolution. The villagers attacked forcing the Baron to flee back to his mansion. He would never make it back in time before he and his wife were murdered.

Izek and the guards put up a fight, though after the Baron was slain they quickly surrendered. Godfrey spoke to Izek and asked him why he followed the Baron's orders. Izek did not have much of an answer, he was rescued by the Baron when he was young and spent the rest of his life in servitude to him. He did not see that his actions were harming the people, but he was blind to the truth.

The rampaging went on into the night, several places of business were ruined, anything with the Baron's name or face was destroyed and burnt to the ground. The people rejoiced throughout the night. The Burgomaster's mansion was mostly ransacked, nothing of value was left behind.

## A New Morning

Over the next two days, the town started to recover, spurred by Godfrey, he helped form a group of people who would make decisions for everyone. These people were known as The Seven and Godfrey vetted them all thoroughly before inviting them to join the newly formed senate.

During this time Godfrey also re-purposed the mansion in a charitable building, there was enough space for children who had no parent, people without homes and a haven for the lame.

Xerus was seen as a hero by the people, everyone knew him and his friends and respected them highly. The Seven agreed that every year on that day they should celebrate "Serpents Release" in honour of Xerus and how he started the revolution.

Arty and Godfrey tucked themselves away from everyone for the whole time. Godfrey was eager to work on Arty and turned his arm and Warhammer into an Armblade. This weapon would mean that Arty was able to swap between his Warhammer and his arm at a moments notice.

Zordar, as one might expect, drank himself into a stooper. He spent much of his time talking to the locals and hearing many stories. Some were seen as rumours and tall tales, though if true would prove valuable information.
