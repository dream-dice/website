# Following The Winding Path

After leaving the tavern, a new member joined the group, a changeling named Cassandra of Quirm. While researching Candlekeep, she found the Book of The Raven and the map and decided to follow the map and catch up with everyone else. Cassandra is an orphan whose parents died before she was born and has always been an outcast. Her book `Getting laid by playing the lute: Tips from an expert` raised many eyebrows but, with her smooth jazz tunes, she managed to convince everyone that it would make a fine addition to the Candlekeep's growing collection.

Together, they found the Hand and Horn. The steps climbing up lead into a peak which looked like a hooked hand point up, in the shape of a horn. When they reached the hill's height, a group of nine dwarven ghosts appeared. They told the group that a book named `A Deep and Creeping Darkness` resided in Candlekeep but was incorrect. It told of a terrible mining accident in Vermilion and its aftermath. The dwarves promised that if they could help them get closure on their death, they would give them the correct entry to update the book. The last thing they could recount before becoming ghosts was a hill with three trees on it where they met a Dragonborn who pointed them in the direction of the Hand and Horn to enjoy the Fertility Festival.

So everyone made their way to Three Tree hill. True to its name, a mountain stood above the rest with only three trees. There were small stone monoliths at its peak with an altar in the centre. Laying on the floor, nine dwarf skulls all looking up in desperate for help. An inscription on the alter read

> Brave warriors met their demise foretold.
> Their secret kept shall yet unfold.
> If crowns are placed correctly on the shrine,
> Celestial beds for four of nine.

On the top of the altar lay sixteen tiles in a four by four grid, each row and column labelled with `I` `II` and `III` and size tiles with stars. Cloud quickly found a solution to lay out the skulls in a way that would open the alter. Each head laughed and thanked everyone as they were placed on the altar and connected to each of the nine dwarves found on the Hand and Horn.

With the puzzle solved, the alter slid open to reveal two books. The first is a wizards book with a skull on its cover. The other was a Gre's journal. After the group poured over the book, they came to understand that Gre was a necromancer who would often bring back the dead grotesquely and horribly. However, he came across a dragon's egg on his travel which spoke to him. He decided to change his ways and raise the dragon. He tricked the dwarves and killed them, using their skills to create an elaborate puzzle if he wished to return to his necromantic ways. Then he left for a nearby volcano to raise this dragon.

As they looked down the deep valley, they could see a large river spanning the valley, with a single bridge to cross. Before they made their way to this bridge, they climbed back up the Hand and Horn to discover that the ghosts had disappeared, and an account of what should have happened in `A Deep and Creeping Darkness` lay on the floor. It started after the accident in Vermilion, a mystery for the group to uncover in the future.

**Truth Behind the Tale**

In response to the swell of terror from the chaos and aftermath of the accident, a nest of meenlocks spontaneously manifested within the bedrock of the mountain. Their strange, twisting lair affixed itself to the tunnels of the mine like a leech. The creatures spent days psychically tormenting the trapped miners before taking them to their lair for further torture and, eventually, transformation. After all the trapped miners were captured or died—or were rescued—the meenlocks turned their attention to the village.

The lingering fear and trauma of the surviving miners called like a beacon to the meenlocks, who exploited the impaired mental states of the villagers and influenced their dreams to sow more terror. Slowly but surely, with ruthless patience and efficiency, the meenlocks tormented and kidnapped the remaining miners, and then started in on their friends and family. Most of the populace eventually fled. Those who remained behind were taken, one by one, and transformed into meenlocks.

A bard who heard about the catastrophe decided to chronicle the stories of the survivors. He traveled the area extensively, avoiding Vermeillon but seeking out its former residents in nearby towns.

His account failed to draw interest, and the book remained among the remnants of his bardic career until his granddaughter found it and sent it on its way to Candlekeep.

There was no time to stop, so they left for the bridge. When they arrived, the bridge stood over a thousand-foot drop, and in the centre of the bridge stood a creature twice as tall as everyone, a troll. He said that he would either throw them over into "Dead Man's Gorge", or they could play a game of riddles with him. Cassandra quickly lulled him with a song and convinced the Troll to let her pass. Once she did so, Florian disguised himself as Cassandra, and she used her changeling ability to transform into a small Troll. He spun around confused, and everyone else ran across the bridge in the chaos. Cassandra felt sorry for him as he cried out in loneliness, but he said he would stay to fill the gorge with others who dared cross the bridge.
