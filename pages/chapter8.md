# Fortunes and Fate

After several days I eventually tracked down the Tser Pool and the place that a group of Vistini travellers stayed. All but one tent remained. It is rare for Vistini to stay in one location for too long, but I had the luck to meet Madam Eva. She is old, rude and hysterical when you talk to her. However, she told me about the adventurers and she read their fortune to me.

I found this a most curious tale, the adventurers were told to take care of the werewolves but are now being told one of them, will aid, them against the terrible Strahd.

Madam Eva also had visions of the adventurers and she shared this information with me and I soon understood why these adventurers had been drawn to this land and one another better. Godfrey's land was cursed by a plague that originates from this kingdom. Xerus was a jester in Barovia and some of the Barovian's found his tricks to borderline cruel, Madam Eva also spoke of an old friend of his who currently resides in Vallaki. She told of how Gorek's family and friends have exiled him for "abusing" weapons and armour. That Artefact - #4546B was built as a conduit for the deity Talos but instead steals Talos's power, this is what lead to his demise and memory loss. A terrible tale of Dwight who sought refuge after a massacre in the cave, filled with fear and hate for everyone and lead to him finding strength in being alone, Madam Eva warned him that Strahd would exploit if he was not careful. Lastly about Zorda whose addiction to drink had caused you great pains in the past and has pushed people away, yet this is what the Brawlers embraced about him and made him stronger for it.
