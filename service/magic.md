## Selling Scroll and Potions

Dathana is not interested in potions or scroll and has no need for them, she will however buy them at `one tenth of their sale value`


## Teleporter

In the basement of this shop is a teleporter which will allow up to 6 willing people to create a teleport link and allow access into. You will need a `Ring of Teleportation` and the spell will take `10 minutes` to create the opening. You can only teleport like this `once per long rest`

## Potions and Scrolls

Dathana will brew potions and write magical scrolls for you. Below is a list of potions she will make for you and the price of a spell scroll. Since there are so manu spells here is a link to them <https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells>

It takes her the price of the item divided by `50gp` rounded up to the nearest day to create the potion or write the scroll. e.g. A Potion of Climbing is worth `100gp` would take `2 days` to brew.
