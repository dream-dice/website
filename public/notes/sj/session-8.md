# Meeting Tialha's Family

* The group left the Academy, well known and respected, welcome back any time
* They wen to Colliar, the home planet of Tialha's family
* There they met Captain Elaine and Flapjack, privateers
* She asked them to vouch for her as she had no papers and landed to repair her ship
* While visiting her family, a giant drone sound came from above and huge root shot out of the ground
* When everyone ran outside chaos insued with people fleeing for their lives or killed by the roots
* As the group went to save people, mindless creatures made of vines attacked, attempting to suck the life out of the group
* They managed to kill the monsters
* They agreed to meet Captain Elaine and save as many people as possible and they'd escape Colliar on her damaged ship
