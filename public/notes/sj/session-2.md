# Boarding the Ruined Ship

* After spending a week training the group has the skills to be a Spelljammer and is tasked with the first mission on basic training.
* They formed a group, with Tialha as the captain, Fluck as the Quartermaster, and Blobby as the pilot. Then boarded a Hammerhead Ship with Abajizn who would assess them on their first mission.
* The mission was to travel to a Flying Fish Ship that had been destroyed and retrieve the captain's log.
* On the way through the asteroid field, they came across a creature fishing for Space Guppies. The group helped Zli'nock capture all the guppies and in return, he guided them to the ship.
* The ship was destroyed. After Tialha changed into a Space Guppy and Hipolomus found a bag of air, and they boarded the ship.
* Being attacked by a severed hand did not stop the group as they went to the bottom of the ship to find more wreckage.
* During their search, they were attacked by three ghosts.
* Throughout their search, Nine-Seven couldn't help but feel that something wasn't right, as though they were in a simulation. She had no way to prove this.
