# Stepping into Hither

*Date:* 2022-07-25

Mister Witch and Mister Light open the gateway to Hither.

* Cloud remained invisible while everyone negotiated with Mister Witch for the watch's safe return.
* The two carnival owners revealed that they had traded contracts with Isolde for a year. She would run the Twilight Carnival while they ran the Witchlight Carnival.
* Instead of returning the contract at the end of the year, the two kept help of the carnival, and genuinly didn't want to ruin something they had never experienced before.
* Both parties agreed to exchange the watch, which could control the carnival, for entry into Hither where the hag Bavlorna Blightstraw ruled over after Zybilna had mysteriously disappeared.
* They made their way to the Hall of Mirrors, and Mister Light showed them the mirror which could take them to Hither.
* Before they left, the two dark elves told them that Prismeer had been broken into three domains, Hither, Thither, and Yon and that the hags of the Hourglass Coven ruled over each one.
* They didn't know too many details since they were contractually not allowed to enter Prismeer, but rumor has it that to find Zybilna, the group will have to travel through each Hither, Thither, and Yon to find Zybylna at the Palace of Hearts Desire. Mister Light gave them a map to help guide them.
* As the group stepped through the mirror, they found themselves on a broken bridge overlooking a swamp surrounded by a mysterious mist.
* While stood on the Queen's Way, they sway a hot air balloon crash into a place known as Slanty Tower, so they set forth to investigate.
* After the group jumped off the bridge, they came across a giant crane eating fish, and a group of brigands dragging a giant snail who wanted to steal their happy memories to give them to their leader Agdon Longscarf.
* The group defeated most of the Brigands with ease, though two of them managed to escape.
* They also made a friend with the Snail and named them Comrade Alex and the crane which they named Buzzy who joined the group and helped them traverse the swamp.
* When they arrived at the Slanty Tower, they flew to the top on the back of Buzzy and found a small Faerie Dragon named Sir Talavar, trapped inside a cage.
* He told them that he needed to get to his queen to tell her about how the Hourglass Coven had trapped Zybilna and that he needed their help to escape his cage. In return, he would give them his powerful sword.
* The group agreed to help him and headed to Telemy Hill to find a goblin key maker named Jingle Jangle.
* They rested at Slanty Tower and found two angry snakes hiding in the nettles surrounding the tower. They left them be and left early in the morning when the swamp water was low enough to travel with Comrade Alex.
* On the way to the hill, the group came across an O'-well. These wells would shout massive amounts of water and raise the tide of the swamp. During low tide several Will-o-wisps came out and played with the group. In return, they granted boons to those who played with them.
