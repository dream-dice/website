# Stepping into Thither

*Date:* 2022-12-28T20:30:00.000Z

The group took their first steps into Thither.

* The group left their hot air balloon while Morgot and Clapperclaw fixed the balloon. It would take two days to fix.
* The group met Nibb in his cave, a blindfolded man from Waterdeep who escaped to the Feywild and Granny Nightshade helped him repent.
* Nib made everyone a magical item weaving his large pile of ill-gotten gold.
* Cassandra took some gold, and saw all the ghosts haunting Nibb. Now a knight ghost started following and taunting Cassandra.
* Nib told the group about Wil, a child who Granny Nightshade was looking to capture. He also told them that Grnny Nightshade can be found in her home of Loomlurch.
* The group went to the Wayward pool, but couldn't gain entry due to the thick magical fog surrounding it. Now and then red lighting would flash over the pool.
* The group met a pack of hunters who worship Malar and asked the group if they could work out a way in, then they would hunt together.
