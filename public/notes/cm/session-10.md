# Through the Grand Library Maze

*Date:* 2022-04-04

Without a moments hesitation the group made their way through Freyots tunnel to find them in the Grand Library.

* The Grand Library was a large and complex maze.
* Many of the books in the library "came to life" with their powers.
* Timagast found a tiny Efreeti with incredible powers, and they are now adventuring together.
* They came across a clock with abilities to alter time, where Cassandra took the hand and put it into her equipment.
* Florain took the "Book of the Raven" from the library after fighting Gory again.
* Timagast took a book named "How the bloody hell do I get out of this blasted maze?" to act as a compass, though the group refused to use it.
* The group found Pittacus, the real one, and he went with them to find and kill Freyot.
* The group found Freyot behind a secret door, hiding in a room full of treasure.
* Freyot used their psychic powers and killed Pittacus.
* Timagast managed to trick Freyot into thinking they would help him hide in Candlekeep and get stronger in an attempt to buy time and wait for Firewatch and back up to arrive.
