# Candlekeep Mysteries

After meeting each other along the way, everyone entered their literature into the archives of the great Candlekeep and joined the ranks of the Avowed as Seekers. Now they are heading into the Feywild to help Mardyck rescue his patron Zybilna.

**Current** The group has set Loomlurch on fire, Skabatha and Bavlona have escaped.

**Next** You are investigating the rest of Loomlurch for any children trapped inside. After you are heading to Yon.

**Why?** If you burn the building down with children inside you are sure Zybilna's curse could be lethal.

* Zybilna is trapped in the Palace of Heart's Desire.
* Skabatha and Bavlorna have escaped to Yon.
* Wil is planning to save the children trapped by Skabatha in Loomlurch.
