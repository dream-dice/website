# Crowning the Witchlight Monarch

*Date:* 2022-07-11

After being crowned the Witchlight Monarch, the heist begins.

* With time left, the group went on the Dragonfly Ride next.
* While flying, Kettlestream showed up and caused mischief, making a dragonfly buck and nearly knocking off a dwarf.
* The group caught Kettlestream and discovered that Zybilna was her patron and that her contract with Zybilna meant she couldn't enter Prismeer to save her.
* She was causing mischief until Mister Witch and Mister Light went to save Zybilna, perhaps not the most thought out of plans.
* Cassandra took a corn husk doll which contained the voice of Candlefoot.
* The group hatched the following plan. Firewatch created a fake watch and vane. While Firewatch and Cloud went to steal the watch and swap it with the fake, Florian and Cassandra would attempt the same thing with the vane.
* They agreed to let Kettlestream go on the condition that she would cause a distraction so that Cassandra and Florian could attempt to steal the vane.
* Timagast planned to fly in the sky on the back of a Giant Dragonfly, ready to dive in and help if needed.
* Next, the group went past the Lost Property and were told that someone was looking for a lost child named Viro. They agreed to help, and Dirlagraun gave Florian a Mirror ball that belonged to Viro, which might resonate if they found him.
* While searching, they saw a frog-like creature dragging a little boy into the Hall of Mirrors.
* The creature dragged the boy into one of the mirrors and disappeared.
* The group checked but couldn't find a way into the mirror again.
* It was revealed that this frog was a Lornling of the "Thieves of the Coven" who worked for Bavlorna Blightstraw.
* While talking to Candlefoot, it was clear that he had no memory of anyone ever going into the Hall of Mirrors, as though under a spell he would just change the subject and forget about the conversation.
* The last attraction the group went on was the Carousel.
* The Carousel was out of order, and Diana Cloppington asked the group to help her fix it.
* While talking to her, she was under a spell and was unable to talk about the Hourglass Coven or how she became half horse half person without vomiting black slime.
* The group fixed the horses, and they telepathically told them that Diana had gone into Prismeer and asked Granny Nightshade of the Hourglass Coven to be reunited with her beloved horse. The hag then united the horse with her, literally. After this, she escaped where Mister Witch and Mister Light recruited her.
* Everyone agreed that Cassandra had brought the most joy into the carnival that day, and crowned the Witchlight Monarch and given a glorious crown.
* While the procession started, the heist commenced.
* Cloud became invisible with the cupcake he had won that day and managed to steal the watch from Mister Witch. Unfortunately, Firewatch was caught trying to swap it with the fake and was struck hard by his cane.
* At the same time, Kettlestream pushed the Calliope into Mister Light while Cassandra and Florian tried to wrestle the vane out of his hands.
* Enraged by the heist, Mister Light stopped the carnival and asked everyone to leave while Mister Witch demanded that the group be taken to the Staff Area so he could get his watch back.
