# Saving the demon prince

*Date:* 2022-12-12T20:30:00.000Z

The group managed to save Graz'zt from the hags.

* Along with Ushi the group took the potion to Zybilna. She showed them where the temple was and said that they needed to lift a curse before she could join them.
* The group asked about her relationship with the three sisters. Zybilna explained that Bavlorna, Skabatha and Endelyn were the three daughters of Baba Yaga. They are known as the hourglass coven owed to each representing the past, present, and future respectively. Baba Yaga had adopted Zybilna and when she went to marry Graz'zt the demon prince she trapped him in the temple and placed a curse on Zybilna.
* The group arrived at the temple and found everything had been petrified in stone. Inside was the bones of a dragon they recognized as Freyot.
* During the fight against the undead Freyot, Cassandra became petrified.
* After defeating the dragon, the group poured half the potion on Cassandra who was now freed from petrification.
* Zybilna showed up now that the curse had been lifted and together everyone went down the stairs at the back of the temple.
* They saw Graz'zt frozen in time in a pool. Zybilna took the potion and poured it on his head. The two fell into a lover's embrace and their kiss changed the hideous appearance of Zybilna into the great fairy godmother that everyone recognized as Iggwilv who has saved them as children.
* As the two embraces laughter rocked the temple and from the shadow emerged horrible laughter. Zybilna identified the woman in the shadow as her stepmother Baba Yaga. The three sisters came downstairs and Ushi took off her disguise, revealing herself as a dark knight named Warduke.
* The group managed to escape, Graz'zt weakened from being frozen for so long fumbled and Zybilna managed to throw him up the stairs saving his life. As Zybilna did so Baba Yaga stabbed her with a knife. Zybilna's body was trapped inside a diamond and the world the group was in shook beneath their feet, dividing into three places. The Not-Slanty Tower fell over and the group saw the world beneath their feet turn into a gaseous swamp.
* The world around them faded and they found themselves back in Bavlorna's Cottage. As the world faded Florian struck a bargain with Graz'zt. If Graz'zt gave him magical powers he would keep his romantic secret and no one would know about the forbidden love between Zybilna and Graz'zt.
* As they came too Morgot was waiting for them on the sofa, with a tiny snail in the palm of his hands. He told them that eleven days had passed since they went into the book. A new Queen had taken over and declared the group as traitors and that they should be killed on site.
* Morgot crept to the balloon he had promised he'd fly with them. There they met Clapperclaw and restored his stags head. Before they left Cloud gave Octavian his heart in exchange for the Pipes of Haunting and met the group in the balloon.
* When the balloon took off two more balloons gave chase. The group managed to destroy the balloons but took heavy damage in the process. Clpperclaw managed to guide Morgot into Thither.
