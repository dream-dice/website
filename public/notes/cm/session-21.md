# A New Reign

*Date:* 2022-10-03

The group helped King Muckstump enforce his laws.

* The group had a wonderful meal with King Muckstump XXVII and said they would speak to his prisoner in the morning.
* Before they met the prisoner, they went to Trinket, Bauble, and Charm's shop.
* Trinket, and Bauble traded several goods and said that if the group went to see Charm in Bavlorna's cottage and have a conversation, they would give them their unicorn's horn. This was before they were insulted, and the deal was taken off the table.
* The prisoner was a knight named Morgort, the Knight of Warts. She was sentenced for treason for aiding and abetting the escape of Sir Talavar.
* Cassandra promised to put on a show during their trial by combat and feign killing Morgort. In exchange Morgot would sneak aboard a balloon and wait for them, with Clapperclaw as a guide she'd be able to take everyone to Thither.
* During the fight, Cassandra almost lost. However, at the last moment, Morgot pretended to die and was kicked into the water where Cloud saw her swim away.
* The group snuck into Bavlorna's Cottage, ready to take on the hag of the Hourglass Coven with an army of Bullywugs in tow.
