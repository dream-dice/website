# Following the Mysterious Map

*Date:* 2022-01-24

After arriving at Wytchway everyone follows the map and it leads them to a volcano, home to a dragon and his speaker.

* When they arrived at Wytchway, someone told them that ghosts brought about a plague of bad luck after gatecrashing the fertility festival at the Hand and Horn.
* They climbed up the Hand and Horn, and the dwarf ghosts mentioned that they came from a platinum mine near Vermillion that was destroyed.
* They don't know how, but they were killed before they arrived at the Hand and Horn. The last place they were at was a hill with three trees on it, and a Dragonborn spoke to them.
* They said that if the group could go investigate and give them the closure, they would give them a correction to a book in Candlekeep named "A Deep and Creeping Darkness".
* When they got to Three Tree Hill, they found an altar with nine dwarf skulls on the floor.
* After placing the skulls on the altar in a specific pattern, it opened up, revealing a wizards book and a journal.
* The journal belonged to Gre, who had decided to leave his necromantic ways to become a dragon speaker after finding coming across a dragons egg.
* It went on to say that he would lock up the book in case it didn't pan out, and to do so, he needed to kill several people, namely the dwarves.
* They returned to the Hand and Horn and found a short extract with a detailed account on how the mine was destroyed.
* From Three Tree Hill, they could see a bridge that was labelled on the map. It was the only way to cross along the river at the bottom of a valley.
* A Troll was on the bridge and asked them to solve a riddle.
* Instead, they tricked the Troll and ran across the bridge.
* When they found the volcano Gre jumped down to see what they wanted.
