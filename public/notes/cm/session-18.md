# Approaching the Brigands Tollway

*Date:* 2022-07-25

The group went to save Sir Talavar and find where Bavlorna lives.

* The group went to Telemy Hill and found a goblin named Jingle Jangle.
* The group exchanged the key to Sir Talavar's cage with a copy of '1001 keys, written by Francis' signed by the Great Reader Firewatch.
* Jingle Jangle explained that Agdon Longscarf had robbed her, now she is afraid to leave her hill and would like Agdon to stop.
* The group promised to put a stop to Agdon. Jingle Jangle told them they could find the Brigands at the Brigands Tollway
* They came across a tavern that worked. Tsu gave them some food and said they could stay overnight if they ever needed it, free of charge.
* While at the tavern, Crinkle told them that there was a riddle in the menu, they solved the riddle, and he gave them Shemshime's Bedtime Rhyme, explaining that the book had a mystery somewhere in the marsh.
* The group went to the Brigands Tollway and found Agdon.
* He stole several things from the group, including Timagast and Florian's names. They are now known as Biff and Chip. Perhaps there is a way for them to reclaim their true identity.
* It was a long fight, but the group defeated Agdon.
