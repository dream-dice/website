# Welcome to Candlekeep

*Date:* 2021-11-21

We meet everyone, and whilst going on Pittacus's tour of Candlekeep, Matreous accidentally locks everyone inside a magical mansion.

* A Druid Dwarf named Timagast, he wrote a book on mushrooms and their effects on people.
* A Tabaxi named Cloud, using his Ranger skills he wrote an incomplete compendium on animals.
* Florian, a Warlock Kalashtar, wrote a book about curing warts. One of the cures worked.
* Lastly, a Warforged Sorcerer named Firewatch. He already resided in Candlekeep. Now a defunct fire warden decided to become a Seeker.
* Pittacus is responsible for taking all new Seekers on a tour of Candlekeep.
* He showed them The Bathhouse where you can get bath salts and tattoos for a temporary buff.
* The smithy where you can purchase or rent animals as well as forge weapons.
* The Outfitters is a place where you can buy and sell magical items, specifically clothes.
* The Hearth where you can get lots of intel from a Troll named Little One
* The House of Rest, a man who could not speak, was attempting to fix a lift. For a long time, the lift had required maintenance.
* There was a church if you need any religious respite.
* The House of the Binder, a place to buy and sell scrolls or wizard books as well as get copies of text from Candlekeep.
* Large emerald doors leading into the heart of Candlekeep, The Great Library. Only a select few Avowed are allowed admittance.
* The Pillars of Pedagogy, a large building full of studies. Here they found Matreous's study empty.
* They found a book "The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces", an exploration into Mordenkeinen's Magical Mansion spell.
* After reading the book, a door appeared.
* Matreous was there. He fled, accidentally locking them in the mansion.
* They were locked inside and unable to leave.
* They find a room with a Mimic chair that knocks Florian out cold.
