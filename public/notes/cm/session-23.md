*Date:* 2022-10-31T20:30:00.000Z

After exploring the rest of Bavlorna's cottage they met with Zybilna after reading a book titled "The Price of Beauty".

* The group explored the cottage some more before turning in Bavlorna's request.
* Cloud sent a sock filled with honey north on one raven while Chip sent a parcel to the east on a different raven.
* Cassandra wrote Mr. Witch and Mr. Light's names in Bavlorna Big Book of Bad.
* The group went upstairs and found Charm's shadow taking an item out of Bavlorna's possessions.
* When they went back downstairs, Charm thanked them and left with her shadow intact.
* Bavlorna thanked the group for the book, the taxidermy (a fox with a duck's head) and removing the ooze from her well.
* In return, she took Florian and Timagast's names out of the BBBB. Gave them Octavian's heart, a stags head for Clapperclaw and a book titled "The Price of Beauty".
* The front of the book contained a mirror with a Graz'zt frozen in place.
* When asked Graz'zt could not remember what this book, but had a fuzzy feeling about it.
* Florian opened the book and the group found themselves in a spa named "The Restful Lilly".
* Florian's patron, Graz'zt was missing and he felt powerless without him by his side.
* A (very) young Bavlorna was there and told them that they could have a gift they desired and while they rested here they would wake with a wonderful gift.
* Cassandra asked to be more dexterous, so Bavlorna wrote Cassandra's name in a scroll and told everyone to enter.
* Bavlorna told them that they could find her sister Zybilna by the pool where they could clean themselves and relax.
* They spoke to Zybilna, who told them that her betrothed, Graz'zt, had been trapped under a temple nearby, and the cure was in a cauldron at the top of her sister's tower.
* The group agreed to help Zybilna and were tasked with trying to find a way into the tower and then Zybilna would escort them into the basement of the temple where Graz'zt was frozen in time.
