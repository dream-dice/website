# Entering Chalet Brantifax

*Date:* 2022-02-7

The mysterious map leads everyone to Chalet Brantifax, the final destination on the map.

* They spoke with Gre and marvelled at Drugry, a red dragon.
* Gre told them he had escaped from Shadowfell, wanting to change his ways and rear this young dragon.
* He told them that he has had left things in a rather bad state and that if they could go to Shadowfell and resolve this for him, he would share some of Drugry's hoard.
* He also mentioned that there was a dragon named Miirym whose hoard was deep in Candlekeep's Great Library and that Drugry aspired to be like Miirym.
* The group agreed to go investigate further, and Gre told them of a crossing at Chalet Brantifax, the final destination on the map.
* When they arrived, there was no one there.
* They found a well with a ghost at the bottom.
* She was a baroness and asked them to find her something to remind her of her loved one, and she would reward them.
* They found a piano with an incomplete music sheet.
* Whilst searching around, they found several articles with notes on them.
* One item was a scroll which stated that after the two baronesses of Chalet Brantifax had died, a group named "The Scarlet Sash" would protect the crossing.
* They also learned that one of the Baronesses (the one in the well) hated the chalet. They had two daughters and a mastiff, and she resented the mastiff as it seemed her spouse (the one in the well) loved it more than her.
* Upstairs, they found a room with a doll that managed to swap places with Cloud and tried to force Cassandra to leave, but then swapped places once again.
* In the attic, they found a crib, and a spectre appeared, attacking them.
* They subdued the spectre and fled downstairs.
* After they found all the notes, they played a song on the piano.
* It opened up to reveal gems and a trinket. The gems were plenty with enough for 30gp worth of gems each.
* They trinket was a locket with two pictures inside, the two baronesses.
* They returned the locket to the woman in the well, and she thanks Cassandra and Cloud for returning the locket and even though she was bitter in life, in death she realised she someone significant to her.
* As she left this plane, she gave them a parting gift and charmed both of them.
