*Date:* 2022-06-27

The group accept Mister Light's invitation and meet him and Mister Witch in the Staff Area.

* Cloud, Cass, Firewatch, and Timagast raced on the Giant Snails where Firewatch won.
* Afterwards, the group went on the Mystery Mine, and after Firewatch left, he was shaking with fear from all the nightmares he saw.
* Feeling peckish, they made their way to the other side of the carnival where they entered the custard pie eating context at the Feasting Orchard.
* It seemed that Timagast was going to win, but at the last moment, he exploded with custard, but Cloud managed to take the win.
* Here they met Ellywick Tumblestrum, a gnome who has traveled many planes of existence. She was looking for Zybilna to ask if she would be her patron.
* Next Cass and Firewatch went on the Gondola Swans where Featherene told them that Palasha, the mermaid, and Candlefoot, the mime, were madly in love.
* Next they went on the Gondola Swans where Featherene told them that Palasha, the mermaid, and Candlefoot, the mime, were madly in love.
* Everyone gathered around Palasha as she started to sing, and a heckler shouted from the crowd causing Palasha to cry.
* Cass and Firewatch used the mage hands and psionic shove to push this heckler into the stream. His disguise faded as he entered the water to reveal a Kenku.
* Palasha said that the Kenku was named Kettlestream and had stolen Candlefoots voice. She was not sure why he hated the carnival but knew he was ruining it for everyone.
* The group went to the Staff Area to meet Mister Light.
* A Bugbear named Burly escorted them to Mister Light and Mister Witch.
* Mister Light was delighted with their performance at the Big Top Extraveganser and wanted to meet them.
* Mister Light was not sure why Kettlestream was ruining the carnival and wanted nothing more than to stop her. He agreed to reward the group if they brought her to them.
* Burly escorted them out and pulled them aside. He was concerned that Mister Witch and Mister Light had been looking after the carnival for too long and wanted the group's help.
* It was revealed the Mister Witch and Mister Light had come from a carnival in Shadowfell known as the Midnight Carnival and traded carnivals with Isolde for a year. This was eight years ago, and Burly was concerned that something nefarious was afoot.
* He suggested that during the Crowning of the Monarch, at the end of the day, they could steal Mister Witch's watch that magically ran the carnival. He was sure they could use that watch to find out how to get into Prismeer to find Zybilna and their plans for the carnival.
