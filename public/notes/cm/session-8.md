# Destroying Gre's Dark Power

*Date:* 2022-03-07

With Urwin, everyone makes their way into Shadowfell to find what Gre had left behind and solve the msteries of the Book of the Raven

* Everyone crawled through the grave and found themselves in Shadowfell. In front of them stood a terrifying mausoleum.
* They entered the building and found several torture devices and chains adorning the building. In one of the sarcophaguses, they found a journal written by a lich named Gregory and the remains of the Book of The Raven hidden in a secret compartment inside.
* The rest of the book details how the author of the Book of the Raven had found a way to escape Barovia and detailed the hole leading through the grave.
* Gregory's journal explained that he had been locked up inside a place known as the Amber Temple. Once a powerful sorcerer named Strahd had been defeated he escaped. Gregory found a group of Vistani and killed them all in a blind rage. He found a dragon's egg, and the love he had for it split his dark power from him. Now he was Gre and Gory. Gre took the pages from Book of the Raven and escaped with the dragon egg. Gory stayed behind and wreaked havoc on anyone he came across.
* Gory attacked from the ceiling, firing arrows at everyone on the ground. He summoned chains to grapple anyone foolish enough to get close to the walls. It was a tough and close fight, during which two gargoyles joined and attacked anyone who wasn't paying attention to the ceiling.
* After dispatching Gory and destroying the gargoyles, Cloud took a ring of jumping from the remains of Gory, and the group crawled back through the hole and out of Shadowfell. Urwin left them to go back to the Scarlet Sash and promised to keep in touch with Cassandra, their latest member.
* They made their way back to the volcano and found Gre, who was no longer a dark Dragonborn, but a blue one. He thanked them and gave them each a bag of gems worth 100gp and a magical hoard item, a book with a large red gem on the cover. So long as Drugry worked to build his hoard, the Dragon-Touched Focus would grow stronger.
* Along with Gre and Drugry, everyone returned back to Candlekeep. Gre and Drugry went into the mountains to look for a place to create a new hoard, but still close enough to learn more about Myiirm.
* Bookwyrm gave everyone a total of 320gp each for the update to A Deep and Creeping Darkness and for a limerick to summarise their mystery.
* In The Hearth, Little One told them that they should seek Pittacus as all Avowed were asked to find Freyot after they had killed again.
