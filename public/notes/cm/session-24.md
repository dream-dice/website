*Date:* 2022-11-13T20:30:00.000Z

After agreeing to help Zybilna the group went into the Not-Slanty Tower to find the potion.

* Timagast wrote his name in the Restful Lily to become more resilient.
* After speaking with Zybilna, Ushi went into the pool for a swim and introduced herself as someone working on her violence issues.
* Next they met Endelyn, one of the three sisters who run the temple. She wore a veil and spoke of her concern for the future
* The group went into the lounge and met PERSON who explained she wanted to be more youthful and that someone disappeared into the Not-Slanty Tower after breaking their promise and trying to leave before the year was up on the contract.
* Next they met Skabatha, the last of the three sisters who run the temple. She had a key in her back and spoke about her interest of the past. She told them how Zybilna was their fourth sister then showed everyone to their rooms.
* The group went and rested in their rooms. Each saw a picture in their room is a memory of the past. Cassandra and Timagast had troubled dreams that night. The next day they felt stronger as though their requests had been granted.
* The group met PERSON and Ushi at breakfast and grew a fondness for Ushi and could see how powerful she was.
* Florian and Cassandra then distracted Skabatha while Cloud burned down the door to the Not-Slanty Tower. Afterward, Florian tricked Skabatha to stay in his room while the group and Ushi ventured into the tower.
* Inside they found Strongheart, bound and gagged in the tower. The three sisters had locked him up for breaking his promise and trying to leave.
* The group did not trust him and dragged him upstairs where they found several large spiders. Ushi, with her flame sword, and Cloud made short work of them.
* At the top of the tower they found a room with 3 beds, one looking like it came from a swamp, one that looked like it was a child's room full of toys and the last was a coffin. They also found a cauldron with the potion Zybilna has spoken of so Florian scooped up the potion in a vessel.
* Ushi and the group bound and gagged Strongheart and left him in the tower after propping him by the door, framing him for setting it on fire.
