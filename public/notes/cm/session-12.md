# Entering the High Forest Village

*Date:* 2022-05-16

Cloud invited everyone to his home to show them around his village enroute to the pumpkin farm.

* Cloud participated in an archery contest with Zack's father. With his last shot, he destroyed the target and won.
* Chocobo Bill has offered everyone to store their mounts at his Chocobo farm and meet the newborn Chocobos.
* Wedge, Jesse, and Biggs explained the Dr. Gast (a satyr) had been looking into the Killmouis and asked the group to go and find her and work out what had been going on.
* Everyone climbed down an old well and found a cave system.
* Cassandra, Cloud, and Timagast were all hexed with something that curdled their blood and periodically paralyzed them.
* Firewatch found several books about dissecting and killing Fey to use their bodies to cure diseases and curses.
* While attempted to steal a book, a Mite jumped out, snatching the book in mid-air and prepared to attack.
