# In the Dungeons

*Date:* 2022-08-27

After fighting Strahd the group leaves the dungeon to search for Sergei's Tomb.

* The group found the crypts and scoured them looking for Sergei's Tomb.
* While here, Efreeti told Xerus that he would give him his aide if he found his sword in the crypts.
* When the group found Sergei's tomb, they found a large tome lying there. As they took it, the coffin started to thump. A familiar voice shouted for help from within.
* They pulled open the coffin to reveal a younger version of Mordenkainen was lying inside.
* She had received a letter from her older/alternate self, who had managed to open the door to Lamordia. A Domain of Dread where Arty had ended up. The letter had a scroll to send her to Barovia, where she promised to help these people destroy Strahd and the domain simultaneously.
* Mord's mentor, Morden, whom she had got her name from, had been manipulated by Griek to create the Domains of Dread. Each one fed Griek with unlimited power, and now Mord planned to destroy them all before he turned the world into a Domain of Dread.
* Each Domain of Dread starts with a catastrophic event, and then loops, feeding Griek with dark energy.
* As the group searched the crypts, they found one filled with lethal brown mold, but also a great sword that would grant the wielder a wish. This was known as the Luck Sword and belonged to Efreeti, now in possession of Godfrey.
* The group left the crypts and found the giant beating heart at the top of a tower. They destroyed it. Blood gushed down the stairs like a waterfall, and they heard a terryfying roar from within the castle.
