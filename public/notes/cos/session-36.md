# Breaking Through Tsolenka Pass

*Date:* 2022-03-12

The group make their way to the Amber Temple via Tsolenka pass and find themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place

* Just as they awoke and ready to set off, Godfrey received a letter from Rolando of The Seven of Vallaki. It was an invitation to celebrate the Heroes of Vallaki at their earliest convenience. The letter also mentioned that an unnamed benefactor had donated several bottles of the illustrious Champagne De Stomp.
* As they got the pass, they found several Sangzor, a monk named Goatku. Goatku was Izek, who had renounced his ways and learned the goat's way. After challenging the group to a sparring match, he let them pass but warned them that things are not what they appeared and that the Amber Temple is very dangerous.
* After humiliating Goatku they found the bridge marked on the map. On it, Strahd and Rahadin stood. In a flash of rage, Mordenkainen ran forward to attack Strahd. Godfrey tried to stop her, but it was in vain as she stopped time for everyone and ran across the bridge to attack Strahd. To everyone's surprise, Strahd's image faded down Mord fell through an invisible hole into the freezing depths below.
* Zordar quickly dispelled the Rahadin illusion with a snowball, then Gorek expertly aided everyone across with his intermate knowledge of stones.
* They approached a wall 124ft high, with a gate made of a mysterious fire. Xerus flew over the wall, past the stone two giant bird statues, and found an outpost on the other side when he landed. The birds lept up and attacked, but they were too slow as he dashed inside the building.
* Using Zordar's cipher scroll, the group dispelled the magic and ran inside the tower to catch up with Xerus. Now there was one bird on top of the tower, and one stood outside.
* While inside the tower, the group realized that the gate was not to stop people from reaching the temple, but to stop things from the temple getting into Barovia.
* Kasimir's quick thinking to blast the cold hand on his shoulder with a firebolt revealed several ghosts hidden behind everyone, readying to slit their throats. The tower was cursed, and the spirits had previously been summoned centuries ago to assassinate everyone in the tower.
* The group made quick work of the specters and rested to strategies how they would get past the birds several times larger than they were and blocked all exits.
