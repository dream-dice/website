# Deafting the Sworn Enemy

*Date:* 2022-07-30

The group scaled the castle walls and killed Rahadin.

* Instead of heading straight through the gates, Xerus flew up, and the group climbed up after him on their rope.
* On top of the wall they found a tough suit of armor which they destroyed.
* Dwight fired several arrows using his boy to find Rahadin.
* The group found stairs. They could feel a pulsating wave of evil coming from above.
* At the bottom of the stairs was a room loaded with dead soldiers from a battle long ago.
* On the other side of the room was Rahadin's office. The group fought hard to take him out and managed to kill him twice, finally killing him.
* The group found a secret door in Rahadin's office leading down, the direction of the Dungeon where Emil is and the Crypts where Strahd's Tome lies on Sergei's tomb must be down there somewhere.
