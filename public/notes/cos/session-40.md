# Meeting Brutus

*Date:* 2022-05-21

The group comes across a mage, hiding from the dangers in the Amber Temple.

* Vilnius and Xerus cast invisibility on everyone they snuck past the Amber giant.
* They found themselves in a room where Vilnius was convinced there was a secret door.
* The secret door led them downstairs, and they climbed up to the library, where Zuleika and Xerus found a book to create a new hound.
* Using Zordar's bone trophy and a piece of amber, Xerus called Efreeti to guide him and create an Amber Hound.
* Xerus named the hound Brutus, and now Zuleika and Xerus had a new member in their pack.
* They went down the spiral staircase and found a large room with three more sarcophagi.
* As they stepped closer several vampires lept out of crates and attacked the group.
* After dispatching them, they found that one of the sarcophagi was a vampire, another was a mighty being, and the last was a spider queen.
