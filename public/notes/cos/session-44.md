# The Fall of the Heros of Vallaki

*Date:* 2022-07-16

The group escaped Vallaki, but returned to destruction.

* Everyone tried to escape the cellar.
* Ronaldo went to take the children from the HQ to the church where the hallowed ground could keep them safe.
* While investigating the cult symbols, Victor Vallakovich teleported into the room, looking to take back his fallen house.
* Everyone struck and killed him, only to discover that was part of his plan the whole time, and he burst into a huge Ghost Dragon named Echo.
* Zordar fell, and Gorek was paralyzed with fear. The outcome looked like certain death for everyone.
* Brutus managed to gather everyone around him, and they all teleported back to Kazahn's Tower.
* They decided to rest until the morning, knowing the Strahd was going to the town but deciding they needed to recover more before they took him on.
* After leaving Ireena behind in the tower once more, the group returned to Vallaki at first light.
* When they got back to Vallaki, they found Van Richten's head on a pike and the word "Cowards" written in blood on the gates.
* At the Blue Water Inn, Urwin, the keeper of the feathers leader and Inn owner, explained that Rictavio was Van Richten, a famous vampire hunter, and he tried his best to kill Strahd and died.
* After Van Richten was killed, Strahd executed the Seven one by one demanding that the Heros of Vallaki come out.
* While this was happening, Goatku (formally Izek) was fighting the Kobolds that Strahd had recruited to destroy the city.
* Strahd left after killing the Seven in anger that the group never showed up.
* The guards managed to kill the Kobolds, but not before they caused massive damage to the town and killed scores of villagers.
* They set off at once and marched to Castle Ravenloft.
