## Teleporter

You all have access to 2 rings to be able to teleport to the cellar in Dathana Magical Emporium and it takes 10 minutes to cast the ritual spell on the ring to teleport yourself and several willing creatures who have been permitted to go there. This means you won't be able to do this during combat or a conversation as you won't have 10 minutes to focus, but a short or long rest is a good chance to do this or if everyone agrees that this can happen.

She will create scrolls, potions and items for focusing magic. Like Princess Cute she sells common items for focusing magic at the price listed above and buys them for half price unless brand new.
She offers a service where she will create spell scrolls. Depending on the spell determines the price of the scroll (at my discretion). It takes 100gp per day to create a scroll e.g. a scroll worth 600gp would take 6 days. She will not buy scrolls or wizard books as she wouldn't be able to find a buyer for them.
