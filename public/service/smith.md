Byllenan will buy and sell weapons, armour and shields from the link above. Like Princess Cute she will buy them at half of their price and sell at the price in the link unless they are brand new, this is her compensation for having to repair items and resell them. Whilst she makes silvered and +1 items she won't buy them because it is rare for people to have enough money to buy these items back off of her.

She offers a service to upgrade weapons, armour and shields to a +1 version of that item. The cost to do so is 10* for weapons and 15* for armour or a shield the price of the item. The item is not magical, she has smithed the item to be stronger and not imbued it with any magical properties.

Another service she offers is to silver a metal weapon, the cost is 10* the items price and if you wish to buy rare silver it will be an extra 50gp.
 
The amount of time it takes to +1 or silver an item is proportional to the cost of the item. For each 5gp of value, it takes a day rounded up e.g. a Shortsword worth 10gp takes 2 days. She offers an express service that costs 10* the total price of the transaction where will only focus on your item and it will reduce the time taken by half.

An example transaction: You want a +1 silvered shortsword and want to know how much it would cost for an express service. You do not have a shortsword or silver.

```
Shortsword cost 10gp
Weapon +1 cost 10*10 = 100gp
Silvered cost 10*10 + 50 (for silver) = 150gp
Total 10 + 100 + 150 = 260gp
Time 10 (the price of the sword) / 5gp = 2 days to +1 and 2 days to silver for a total of 4 days. Express service 10*260=2600gp and it would take 2 days.
