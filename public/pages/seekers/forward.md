# As The Tale Unfolds

## Forward

Ever since I read my first story, "The Vampire Hunters of Barovia", I have had a thirst for knowledge and known escape from the realities of the harsh world through books and stories. I have yearned to become an Avowed and roamed the Great Library within Candlekeep ever since I learned of its very existence. Candlekeep is a mysterious place, and admittance is to publish a book into their archives.

I have travelled far and wide in search of a new and exciting topic. As luck would have it, I stumbled across four adventurers who had just started their journey as Seekers, and they inspired me to follow their journey.

A Tabaxi named Eshrinn travelled around, learning about beasts and monsters on his journey. He would pick up some knowledge on everything he came across, perhaps not extensive as one might have hoped for from a Seeker. Nonetheless, The Compendium of Beasts was entered into Candlekeep.

A particularly hairy and Dwarf named Timagast crossed paths with Eshrinn whilst learning about fungus of all varieties. As they travelled together for a while, they became good friends. Timagast wrote "A Comprehensive Guide into Funghi, Fungus and Fun Guys, " which detailed the many effects that mushrooms' had on individuals.

Whilst these two adventured. They came across a curious fellow named Florian. He was a Kalashtar who would often preach self-motivation or quick hot tips for self-improvement. These speeches first caught the attention of Timagast and Eshrinn, who quickly realised that many of his motivational speeches were either nonsense or a rouse to make money. His book "10 Things You Won't Believe that Can Be used to cure Warts, that Work" was a book he wrote and coincidentally one of the items on that list worked and so the book was entered into Candlekeep.

Firewatch is an especially curious small construct which, unlike the other seekers, already lived within the walls of Candlekeep. Firewatch had one job, to put out fires in Candlekeep. However, several spells and tutorials on fire safety put him out of a job, and he would spend his time working at the House of the Binder copying texts from the Great Library. When these adventurers went on their tour, Firewatch saw Eshrinn light a pipe and quickly put it out. He was weary of these people at first, always watching out for fires, but it didn't take long before he became friends with them. The Avowed agreed to make him a Seeker allowing him to start his journey for his love of books.
