#  Griek's Frustration

Lead by Arty, the group head out to the thunderous churchyard. They arrived, the fog was not as thick in the air as the rest of the swamp, but the putrid smell of death lingered in the air instead. They walked through the gate, greeted by a small dwarf wearing a long cloak over an open grave. He started to chant and summoned forth a lighting strike, waking a monstrous beast that resembled Arty.

The dwarf revealed himself to be Griek, and instantly Godfrey was taken over with rage and vengeance as he recognised the person who had tortured him in Strahd castle. Griek was no longer interested in him but thanked Godfrey, for after his "death" in Ravenloft he came back stronger and hungrier for knowledge than before.

Griek toyed with the adventurers, making a mockery of their strength. He recognised Arty as the works of an "inferior" model from Dr Mordenheim and pointed his decayed finger at him, instantly killing Arty where he stood. Though Arty fell to the ground, the chip, given to him by the Spellworkers, inside his head triggered, and he instantly arose, a new person with a more powerful soul than before. Griek was frustrated.

> Perhaps you can't just build the ultimate machine or the perfect monster. It would seem you need to grow and become more powerful through harsh and challenging experiences. I see this is a failed experiment.

As the group challenged his notions and ideas, he mocked them. Telling them that they didn't understand, they would never be able to escape. They were not in the material plane; they were in a Domain of Dread known as the Shadowfell. Strahd, consumed by the Shadowfell, dragged the whole of Barovia in with him. The group would never be able to escape the horrors of Strahd whilst he was alive. Griek, however, had surpassed Strahds powers. He ordered his construct to fight to the death, then he turned to the group and said,

> Say Hello to Strahd from Griek. I am so much more powerful than he will ever be! Arty, if you wish to find me, I am heading to Lamordia to find Dr Mordenheim and continue his research. Perhaps we can answer your questions, make you stronger, more powerful than any construct before.

He clicked his fingers and vanished in an instant.

The group finished off the lightning golem quickly now that its master was no longer around. They were low on spirits but investigated the churchyard some more. They found, inside the church, what remains of a phylactery which would have kept Griek alive forever, now a useless piece of crystal with no power. Godfrey recited some knowledge of the domains of dread when learned whilst at the monastery.

> The domains of dread are pocket dimensions, created from the purest of darkness and evil. When an innocent soul steps into that domain, they can't leave without destroying that evil. It would seem my thirst for vengeance will not go unquenched as I will have Strahds head and leave this wretched domain!
