# As The Tale Unfolds

## Forward

This chronicle is the untold adventure of a band of intrepid crusaders. Nothing has been altered or changed and the fact presented have only be given my artistic flair. I have been investigating and following the story of these adventurers from as far back as I can trace and have yet to learn how their story ends. Adventurers who have entered Barovia in the past have never returned, will the fate of these people be the same as those before or will they overcome the challenges and make it out alive? Only time will tell.
