# Purging the Winery

Dwight made his way into the cellar on his own. He was so silent and quiet that even when he was stood next to magically concealed druids and blights they could not detect him. Unfortunately, he did not see the trip rope which alerted the two druids and nine blights. Dwight was attacked on both sides, instantly one of the druids created a thunderous wave and the blights attacked him. Xerus, Zordar and Godfrey were currently engaged in battle with the blights upstairs so Arty made his way downstairs to help him. Arty was just in time as the druids knocked Dwight unconscious, he managed to stabilise him and the two of them finished off the rest of the foul creatures who hid in the cellar. Before they killed the last druid they asked him what they were searching for. To their delight he wouldn't say, only that his master was looking for something, so they silenced him once and for all.

The rest of the group had taken care of everyone on the first floor and joined the others downstairs. Dwight now understood that he could not run around a building on his own which was filled with all manner of monsters. Together the group went upstairs, at the top of the stairs stood a druid on top of a winch, he shouted at the group and told them they would all die before the night was through and that they could stop him, then he lept down and fled. Godfrey charged after him but was unable to catch up, this halfling was faster than any he had seen before.

The adventurers continued to search the building, to make sure it was clear. They came across the master bedroom and found a chest, inside the chest was lots of gold and after much investigation, ending in Zordar using his axe to smash it open, they found a secret compartment container more treasure and a (now) sliced up painting of a woman who appeared to be wearing a wedding ring. Zordar also took a bottle of champagne. The label read

> Corked: Fa 13 Dravago 988YK
>
> The last vintage bottle of wine, lovingly corked by my darling wife Angelika
>
> May her soul find peace from this wretched world

Xerus explained that, whilst he had never even seen a bottle of this mythical wine he knew quite a bit about it. The champagne is named Champagne du le Stomp and it is priceless. No one in Barovia has had a bottle of this coveted wine in ten years. Before then the wine was worth 1gp a bottle, a small fortune for the poor but for the few wealthy people living in Barovia it was a delightful experience. They say a nights sleep after a single glass of this champagne will be one of the sweetest and most blissful sleep you will have ever encountered. Zordar is very knowledgeable about alcohol (and not a lot else). He could tell that on Fa 13 Dravago 99YK this bottle will start to go sour and will be worthless. Luckily the wine is at its best right now and will be so for 3 more months.

Dwight snuck on ahead and saw two vine blights and a druid rummaging through the printing room. In a hushed voice Xerus and Dwight snuck up ahead and with an almighty fireball Xerus almost took out everyone in the room. Together the group finished them off without any difficulty. The druid was tight-lipped, much like the one in the cellar. The group gathered and could sense the building was empty, however, Dwight suspected that the druid who got away was the master and that their troubles were not yet over.
