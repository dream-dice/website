# Twisted Teleportation

As our adventurers journeyed further into the attic they were greeted by, not just the stale air and buildup of dust, but also by the powerful sense that dark magic was going on. When they made their way into the room they saw a man, Victor Vallakovich, who was the Baron's son. He quickly shut the door on them and summoned forth several ferocious skeleton cats. The adventurers made short work of them, but then they had to deal with a powerful mage, who with one evocation summoned a mighty snowstorm bringing some of our adventurers to their knees.

They made it into the room and confronted him. It was here that Zordar realised his Greataxe was missing as he went to grab it and strike down Victor, and so too were Arty's Warhammer and Gorek's silver. All that was left was a note that read.

It was Xerus who found a book of ramblings containing necrotic incantations to summon forth a teleportation circle like none he had ever heard of before. Victor said that he was trying to escape Barovia and that he had had enough of this world, it is enough to drive anyone mad.
