# Chapter 5 - The Fallen Brethren

The party sat around the table, desperate to leave and too tired to carry on. All but one of the party found the will to carry on. Ku-Quar now carried the fears that Thorne possessed, haunting his every thought. His only motivation was that if they all carry on perhaps they would all die and end the misery.

The party went to the dungeon that only Gorek had explored thus far. The reliquary containing several dismembered parts of previous adventurers left everyone feeling uneasy as they approached the continual chanting.

They entered a room submerged in water. In the centre, there was a raised dais and when Zordar approached the dais several spirits appeared and chanted "One must die!" over and over again. The ghostly figure held out a twisted dagger in its hand offering it to the party.

In a blinding motion, Ku-Qaur dashed forward and declared that he would rather die than go on. He took the knife, slit his throat and let the blood fall down upon the altar. However, the house had more in store for the party. Rage and vengeance filled the body of Ku-Qaur. He raised himself off the floor and turned no the party. "How could you do this to me, why didn't you stop me!?" and he attacked the party.

Whatever was coursing through his body was not blood, but hate, and it fuelled his every action. He quickly took down Arty who had tried to stop him from dying but before he could do any more damage he was slain. Whilst his body was gone his soul was trapped in this plane and doomed to haunt the party forevermore.

The house it would seem was appeased by this offering and the curse was lifted. The party left the house, and a curious thing happened as Dwight stepped through the doorway. One of the rings in his pocket, spoils from the house, started making music. A fanfare started and from the ring came a Tiefling named Xerus shouting "I'm free at last from that wretched house!". Xerus then joined the party in their quest to slay the werewolves of the mist.

The taste of freedom did not last long, however. A skinny figure dressed in black handed the part a wax-sealed letter. An invitation from Strahd to dine with him. After the group accepted the figure hissed at them and darted into the mist.
