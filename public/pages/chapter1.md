# Chapter 1 - Werewolves in the Mist

We begin our tale in the village of Daggerford. Where the mayor, a stoutly fellow by the name of Gerder, sent out a request to the Faction Oversight Guild as the town is in dire need of help. A pack of werewolves had been ransacking the village, killing, stealing and abducting fair maidens, the locals called them “the werewolves in the mist”.

Two guilds took up the call and in total sent five adventurers.

From the Wraith Raiders, a faction who favour hiding in the shadows and will get anything done no questions asked sent three of their newest members. Dwight Ribble, an Elf Ranger who is quiet, quick, nimble and is always hiding in the shadows. Godfrey the Guardian, a Human Paladin who answers to Helm and looking to right the wrongs of those who have more wealth than sense and protect those who cannot protect themselves. Lastly a Lizardfolk Ranger by the name of Ku-Quar who had previously worked with Dwight on previous missions.

The call to learn more about Werewolves was too strong for the Spellworkers to resist so they sent two of their newest recruits. Artefact - #4546B, or better known as Arty, a Warforged Cleric who found in a dig being conducted by the Spellworkers, then after being booted his memory is all but gone and he is learning not only about himself but also about the world around him. Gorek “Grizzled-Face” Gottrison, a Dwarf Artificer who was shunned from his family after tinkering with items and using unknown and new techniques.

The mayor called a meeting at the town hall where all the faction member met. A generous reward of fifty gold pieces was offered for the eradication of the werewolves. During the negotiations, Godfrey convinced the other members that eighty per cent of the reward should be given to the poor and those in need and they could split the rest of the 20% with the rest of the party. The mayor also agreed to start the "Godfrey foundation for the poor, needy and other similar shit" on the successful completion of this request. Everyone signed the contract and plenty of ales was had.

At night-fall of that same day Tibbles, a local ranger who had been tracking the werewolves, lead the party to the Misty Forest. When they arrived he bid them good luck and left. As night fell the adventurers follow the path, coming across a small group of goblins the party took them out with ease. Soon they came upon poor prints which were assumed to the be the prints of the werewolves and they made the mist.

The party were completely consumed in this thick and dense mist which turned into an impenetrable fog, making it hard to breathe and impossible to see. Each person in the party heard their names be called in the fog as they chased down shadowy figures, assumed to be the werewolves.

Somehow, by chance, they found their way through the mist, together they faced an old and abandoned manor. In the wall around the manor, a dark shadow lept through a break in the wall, leaving the party to question what fate had in store for them.
