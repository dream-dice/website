# Opening The Doors

The group made their way to the top floor. A fantastic suite of plate armour stood at the top of the stairs, the right fit for Florian, who now felt more robust after the attack from the chair. He was still cautious of chairs and benches after being knocked out by the mimic chair, but he pushed on.

In the ceiling, they found an attic door. After climbing up, Florian fumbled around in the dark. The floor beneath gave way, and he fell. The room contained a large bookcase and a locked door. Timagast fell as well, and when they started looking at the shelf to find a way out, it attacked them, almost flattening them in the process. Luckily they got through the locked door and, with the help of the rest of the group, destroyed the bookshelf from the outside. Cloud found a book on the destroyed shelf titled "Martial Attack Techniques" and turned it into a mighty flail. Another book found in the room titled "Lookout" had the letter "L" in a large font and yet again embossed in gold.

The library was hidden behind a secret door, now broken, and after looking in a laboratory, they found a book titled "The Night Sky" where the letter "T" followed the same pattern.

The group made their way into a large bedroom where Cloud made lifelong friends with a black cat who now follows him wherever he goes. There was also a book by the bed titled "Everyone's a critic", where the letter "E", once again, was large and embossed in gold.

The final room in the mansion was a large trophy room, warm with a fire on one side and several tables and chairs with books. When everyone entered, two swords above the fireplace sliced at everyone, but not for long, and they soon fell to the floor. On one table was "You should know how to get out by now", with the letter "Y" large and embossed. A journal on the table written by Fistandia with the following entry caught their attention.

> Freyot approached me and told me how to take books from the library whilst staying within the rules of Candlekeep. Slowly my collection of books grew, and eventually, Freyot joined me in the mansion. They started making all sorts of creatures and experimenting with all kinds of necrotic techniques. Frey is using my stolen books, and if I close the mansion, they have promised to tell the others in Candlekeep, and I will indeed be exiled. No doubt people will believe I was responsible for the horrible experiments in the basement.

After this entry, the journal finished. There seemed to be no more evidence in the mansion of Freyot. Even Freyot's homunculus, Cumin, had no clue about their master's whereabouts.

The group stood perplexed on how to escape. Then, just like a lightning strike, it struck Cloud. All the letters together spelt a word, and he called out "LIBERTY". The doors opened, revealing the light from the Pedagogy study.
