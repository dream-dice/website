# Descending the Secret Staircase

The group didn't have time to help Florian, so they carried on, leaving him gasping for air on the floor. In the next room, two Homonculis were busy making bread. They told the group about their masters and how they were ordered to make bread but never allowed to be freed of it until they were given a new command or the command word to stop them from moving. The only thing they knew was that the books in the house held a clue on how to leave.

They left the two small minions and decided to look at the study. Timagast pulled a book off the shelf, "How to make a hidden door", and the shelves pulled forward, revealing a secret staircase. Another book caught their attention as it was out of place, "Interesting ways to trap people", where the letter "I" was large and embossed in gold.

The group walked down the staircase and found a room that smelt strongly of chemicals and filled with small creatures and body parts in jars. As Firewatch walked in, several hands immediately lept out to strike and use his Mage Hand. He distracted them so they could flee. Together they made a plan to attack the monsters in the room. Timagast ran in first, smacked his hands together, and a mighty boom echoed through the room, killing all the hands in one fell swoop.

They found a vat and within floating bits of flesh and wood when they looked in. The mystery of the mimic chair revealed the chair, and several other monsters had been created down here. Dismembered hands and a grotesque creature sprung forward to attack with that revelation. The efforts were in vain as they perished under the group's strength.

Another room contained a circle in the centre, pulsating with raw arcane power. Cloud picked up a mysterious frog on the floor, then chucked it into the ring, revealing a Quasit which promptly attacked. The fight was quick and painless.

The final room downstairs was locked, but Timagast used his great club and destroyed the door. The books in this room detailed how to make homunculi and keep them from perishing after an hour. You would need to focus on them and give them a single purpose, perhaps to make bread and only bread. A book titled "Binding souls" on its spine also contained a letter large and embossed in gold, the letter "B".

They checked the library with nothing else to find. They shook and moved as they started looking at the books on the shelves. It toppled over and nearly knocked over some group members who managed to jump out of the way. The books started animating and attacking the adventurers who fought back and thwarted the attack.

They looked through the wreckage they found several books of interest. Timagast found a book named "How to turn ordinary items into weapons" and made a new club with all the books and broken parts of shelves he found in the room. Among the books was one that stood out, "Readers digestion, brilliant bread edition", the letter "R" was large and, again, embossed in gold.

What did the letter "I", "B", and "R" have to do with escaping the mansion? The group was perplexed and continued searching for more books in the mansion.
