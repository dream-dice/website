# The Gottrisson Mine

When the group awoke their next heading was the Wizard of Wines. Ireena approached Godfrey, giving him her shield and her sword which was covered in silver, this explained why she was able to fend off the hags with ease, she did not see a need for these items now that she was the lady-in-waiting. Here Dwight had his job to kill Urwin's father, no know knew of this. Zordar promised to bring back alcohol for Vallaki. On the way, however, Gorek asked that they take this rumoured route which was discovered in the sewers under Vallaki. If rumours are to be believed it would provide safe passage around Barovia and is a place that Strahd was unable to get access to.

When they arrived at the sewers they a Kobold hailed them and said he would take them on a tour of the sewer on their way to this mysterious door. On the way there he explained that the Vallakians let them live, and allowed them to dig away in the sewers and protect them from Strahd. In return, they were to feed the Gelatinous Cube any waste and keep them at bay. They were a social community and took it in turns to do different jobs.

When they came to cubes on the Kobolds who was on duty fell in, and several cubes came out. The Kobold leader told them that they would often send wave after wave of Kobolds to knock them back into the sewer. The group quickly knocked them back, and Zordar had the ingenious idea to throw the leader at the last one. So a new leader stepped forward and took them to the door.

When they arrived at the door the scroll revealed two shining stars on the door and a message which was written in Primordial which translated said

> ql nixl kfzgly onl yffp idivmwo wopiny. ql nixl rmzfxlply fm fb nvw qligmlwwlw. qnlm nl qiylw vm el nl bpllslw imy hro qnlm v ie wovkk nl vw bpll, qnio ie v? imwqlp onvw of rmkfzg onl yffp of onl dfoovwwfm hipfxvi evml

The letters on the scroll locked into place on `xevminahqbwfsoztcyjdpgrkul`

Zordar worked out that the phrase was translated to

> We have locked the door against Strahd. We have uncovered one of his weaknesses. When he wades in me he freezes and but when I am still he is free, what am I? Answer this to unlock the door to the Gottisson Barovia Mine

The group thought for some time, and after a couple of failed attempts realised that the answer was `running water` and the door opens up. The scroll explained that the idea behind the riddle was two-fold. The Gottrisson's knew the Strahd did not know the Primordial language, but even if he did he wouldn't dare reveal his weaknesses to anyone. After they all entered the scroll said `Zordar, speak a phrase and the door will reseal with that` to which he replied `Oh balls` and then the door locked behind them, plunging them into magical darkness.

After lighting torches and magic spells they made their way cautiously into the mine. The first room they entered contained what appeared to be spheres on a table. When they turned to leave a massive spider descended from the ceiling. It spoke to Godfrey telepathically and told him the following

> We do not mean you any harm as we do not eat the living. We can travel between this and the ethereal plane at will. When my tribe came here we were stuck, unable to return to our home. We found refuge in this mine that Strahd and his spies have been unable to get into for over 500 years, we were only able to get here by chance.

The spider asked them whether they knew what happened to souls when they have their hosts have died in Barovia. The reply was unsettling.

> Souls are trapped in the ethereal plane, unable to leave. They are either reborn into people here, in Barovia, and worn down over time, or Strahds fiends torture them for all time. My tribe has taken it upon themselves to free those souls that have been trapped and tortured by Strahd. If you let us reside here until Strahd has been defeated then in return, should your soul leave your body, we will gladly free you from such a horrible fate.

Godfrey thanked them for this information and they all agreed to leave the spiders alone. The group went further into the mine, and came across a pit, pulsating with red light. The first light they had seen in the cave. Inside the pit was an uncountable pile of skeletons.
