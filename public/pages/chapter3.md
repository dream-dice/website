# The Forgotten Children

The group made their way into the attic. Up here there was very little, several small rooms. There was however a door with an iron lock. Unable to pick or destroy the lock Arty ran back downstairs to the library and retrieved a key for the lock.

Two small skeletons, holding each, lay in the middle of the locked room. In one corner a toy box and the other a dollhouse. The dollhouse was a replica of the manor, complete with 6 adventurers who resembled our party. It quickly dawned on everyone that the child skeletons in the room were that of Rose and Thorn, the children in the paintings and the two who greeted them outside the house.

On closer inspection of the dollhouse a secret door was revealed which showed stairs going down below the house. Suddenly two ghosts appeared where the children lay. Rose and Thorn told everyone about the monsters in the basement and the howling which their parents were protecting them of by locking them inside this room.

As the party left to go down the stairs, Arty was possessed by Rose, and acting like a petulant child lead the way down the stairs. Thorn meanwhile, out of fear of being left behind, took possession of Ku-Quar and chased after her. The rest of the group followed them down the stairs and under the house to a dugout dungeon where continual howling could be heard.

The group discovered this dungeon housed a crypt, with empty tombs for Gustav and Elizabeth Durst as well as tombs for the children whose starved remains were left in the attic.
