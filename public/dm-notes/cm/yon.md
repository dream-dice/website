tomorrow I think I should be fine

They will go back in and deal with the children and the people locked up
Then they will head to Yon
They need a baloon to fly over the mountains, luckily enough time has passed that Clapperclaw and Mort can help them get across
This will then mean I can say "you can fly and no one cares anymore because we worked it out"
As they fly they will be attacked by the archlight, without Matt and Lewis it might be tough, but I think they will be able to manage it
Then they will crash land in Yon
They will attract Dandy, Bee, and Twin who will tell them what's going on


The path I want them to follow

1. They go to Henge first, perhaps the easiest way is for dandy to say "your magestiy should play chess with her magesty"
2. They should help out with the mine incident, but on the way Shemshime breaks out and each one needs to do a save, after which they can only speak lines from the song in order, so they can't, for example, pick out words and construct their own sentence
3. Once they have done that they should keep heading to the mine
4. I think the Cyclops should show up on the way this time
5. Then they get to the mine and do that bit
6. They are meant to be able to get in the sneaky way here
7. Then they can do the Motherhorn, where the witches will escape. I think this time they will end up using dimension door and escape with a "break glass" kind of thing "Mother told us we can only do this once, but we are at a dissadvantage here. Lets haul it to the place

Then they flee again to the castle and the three freaks can show them the way

I think I would like Squirt, Clapperclaw and Dandy to be like "Zybilna is going to save us if we wish it. I will finally get a break, squirt will get a heart and dandy will get courage". I will say that they work together on their turn like some messed up comedy trio
