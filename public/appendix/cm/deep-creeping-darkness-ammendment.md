**Truth Behind the Tale**

In response to the swell of terror from the chaos and aftermath of the accident, a nest of meenlocks spontaneously manifested within the bedrock of the mountain. Their strange, twisting lair affixed itself to the tunnels of the mine like a leech. The creatures spent days psychically tormenting the trapped miners before taking them to their lair for further torture and, eventually, transformation. After all the trapped miners were captured or died—or were rescued—the meenlocks turned their attention to the village.

The lingering fear and trauma of the surviving miners called like a beacon to the meenlocks, who exploited the impaired mental states of the villagers and influenced their dreams to sow more terror. Slowly but surely, with ruthless patience and efficiency, the meenlocks tormented and kidnapped the remaining miners, and then started in on their friends and family. Most of the populace eventually fled. Those who remained behind were taken, one by one, and transformed into meenlocks.

A bard who heard about the catastrophe decided to chronicle the stories of the survivors. He traveled the area extensively, avoiding Vermeillon but seeking out its former residents in nearby towns.

His account failed to draw interest, and the book remained among the remnants of his bardic career until his granddaughter found it and sent it on its way to Candlekeep.

There was no time to stop, so they left for the bridge. When they arrived, the bridge stood over a thousand-foot drop, and in the centre of the bridge stood a creature twice as tall as everyone, a troll. He said that he would either throw them over into "Dead Man's Gorge", or they could play a game of riddles with him. Cassandra quickly lulled him with a song and convinced the Troll to let her pass. Once she did so, Florian disguised himself as Cassandra, and she used her changeling ability to transform into a small Troll. He spun around confused, and everyone else ran across the bridge in the chaos. Cassandra felt sorry for him as he cried out in loneliness, but he said he would stay to fill the gorge with others who dared cross the bridge.
