* The Vistani are planar travellers often encountered in the Shadowfell, and they seem to be immune to the despair that besets all other visitors to that plane. They travel in horse-drawn, barrel-shaped wagons and have no permanent home.
* The Vistani display their wealth openly as a sign of prosperity, sharing their good fortune with friends and strangers alike. Vistani resolve disagreements through contests that end with reconciliatory singing, dancing, and storytelling.
* Vistani families can be big or small, but each family is a gerontocracy, with the oldest member ruling the roost. This elder is responsible for enforcing traditions, settling disputes, setting the course for the group's travels, and preserving the Vistani way of life.
* The Vistani have the power, some say gift, to travel through the mists that lead to forlorn realms within the Shadowfell known as the Domains of Dread, where creatures born in darkness dwell. This "gift" was thrust upon them by mysterious entities called the Dark Powers as a boon for their kindness toward strangers.
* The Vistani believe that ravens carry lost souls within them. Hence, killing a raven is considered bad luck in Vistani culture.
